1
00:02:54,569 --> 00:03:00,769
GREETINGS

2
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:07,369
From this Center of Studies

3
00:03:07,369 --> 00:03:14,099
I want to greet the friends

4
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:21,099
congregated in Caucaia Park, near Sao Paulo

5
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:26,339
in Attigliano Park, near Rome

6
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:30,609
in Manantiales Park, near Santiago

7
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:34,809
in Toledo Park, near Madrid

8
00:03:34,809 --> 00:03:40,459
in Red Bluff Park, near San Francisco

9
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:45,089
in La Reja Park, near Buenos Aires

10
00:03:45,089 --> 00:03:52,169
in Kandroli Ashram, near Mumbai

11
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:55,849
in Kohanoff Park, near Resistencia

12
00:03:55,849 --> 00:04:02,849
in Punta de Vacas Park, between Chile and Argentina

13
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:10,349
I trust that in the next months

14
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:15,939
our reflections can reach

15
00:04:15,939 --> 00:04:21,459
not only the main Parks

16
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:29,699
located in the different continents, countries and regions

17
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:35,659
but other smaller ones, to all the Halls, big and little and the Centers

18
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:40,469
which so many dear people visit

19
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:41,300
THE MESSAGE AND THE HUMANISTS

20
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,930
I take this opportunity to reach out to all the places

21
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:51,249
where this human gathering

22
00:05:51,249 --> 00:06:00,629
makes of the Message a profound reference

23
00:06:01,809 --> 00:06:04,949
But, we should clarify

24
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:11,369
to these places go not only people that adhere

25
00:06:11,369 --> 00:06:17,279
to this spiritual, ethereal and disorganized Message

26
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:24,619
but also those organized members of the Humanist Movement

27
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:31,039
who work vigorously to Humanize the Earth

28
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:40,159
I especially address the latter on this occasion

29
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:43,050
Of course

30
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:54,229
I should not and I cannot give an opinion on the functioning or on the diverse activities the Humanist Movement produces

31
00:06:54,229 --> 00:07:08,529
but neither can I stop encouraging this colossal undertaking, which is so strongly required in the present circumstances

32
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:16,889
The world, more than in other times, is in need of Humanism

33
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:22,849
and we are in need of Humanism

34
00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:32,449
because clearly we feel the urge for the progressive humanization of the world

35
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:37,770
HUMANIST ACTION

36
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:44,610
I want to emphasize the need for humanist action in different cultural environments

37
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:48,240
and in diverse population strata

38
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,559
because it happens, contrary and unfortunately

39
00:07:54,559 --> 00:08:03,479
that the events are indicating an overflow of violence in all fields

40
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:12,439
and a deterioration of all references for the individuals and the people

41
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:20,709
It is not useless to point out that Universal Humanism

42
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:29,059
as today the possibility of creating a non-violent conscience and action

43
00:08:29,059 --> 00:08:39,519
and to become a reference for broad sectors of the world’s population

44
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:50,810
It is clear that Humanism, to be effective, must have an organized Movement,

45
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:55,480
participatory and flexible

46
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:05,460
giving special importance to the diffusion of its ideas and activities

47
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:14,080
So then, the Humanist Movement should clarify itself

48
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,170
regarding its fundamental characteristics

49
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:30,310
and, at the same time, clarify this for the organizations to which it gives “origin” and inspiration

50
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:37,120
Social, cultural, political organizations

51
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,490
and action fronts that consider themselves humanists

52
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:47,000
should coincide in their basic proposals

53
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:56,120
at the same time that they follow a general strategy of the diverse and of the convergent

54
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:58,180
CLARIFICATION AND REFLEXIVE ACTION

55
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:07,560
Naturally, to clarify itself regarding its fundamental characteristics

56
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:14,740
and to clarify this for the organizations to which it gives origin and inspiration

57
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:23,760
the Movement should study and diffuse its foundational documents

58
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:30,390
and the new documents that respond to the most recent needs

59
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:34,360
This subject is of the utmost importance because

60
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:47,000
it is not only about a decisive and almost reflex type of action in the social environment

61
00:11:47,000 --> 00:12:02,640
but rather a reflective action that requires a total comprehension of that which is being done

62
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:07,490
It is important to comprehend the meaning of the action

63
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:18,910
and not to accept a confused medley of empty slogans that fill the media

64
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:24,850
It is equally necessary to reach the people

65
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:31,970
with brief and consistent expositions

66
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:41,750
formulated in most cases only through the televised media

67
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:46,320
But, without a doubt, the best diffusion will be based

68
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,060
not only on core proposals

69
00:12:51,060 --> 00:13:03,800
but also on exemplary actions capable of giving participation to ample segments of the population.

70
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:10,920
On the other hand, we must recognize

71
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:21,240
that the Humanist Movement has been born and has developed during an epoch of world crisis

72
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:34,040
and because of that it does not feel horrified by change and by the continuous adaptation to the new times

73
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,760
Accordingly

74
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:46,980
to perfect its organizational flexibility is a connatural direction to its development

75
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:53,980
ACCELERATION AND REACTION

76
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:59,020
In any case, we must admit

77
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:08,580
that the situation of continued and progressive crisis that the citizens live with today

78
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:17,580
goes on undermining the possibilities to foresee events

79
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:28,880
and, in such a state of things the people feel the frustration of the future

80
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:38,400
and increasingly distrust any proposal that goes beyond that which is immediate

81
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:44,220
All of this is accompanied by the dissolution of structures

82
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:51,460
that, until recently, were references for people.

83
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:56,300
The acceleration of historical tempo

84
00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:07,090
that not long ago, ended up finishing, the feudal and colonial remnants

85
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:16,530
has continued to advance towards the frail structures of the nation states

86
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:21,160
At the same time, regionalizations continue to advance, not without obstacles

87
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:26,110
against the old agonizing nationalism

88
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:32,060
This dynamic includes many reactions

89
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:42,200
which we can also observe in the growing chauvinism in the core of the countries and national regions

90
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:50,680
and also, more amplified, in the center of the international regions

91
00:15:50,690 --> 00:16:00,290
which tend to excessive affirmation of the supranational culture

92
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:05,120
Such a reaction of the supranational cultures is modeling

93
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:11,010
new glorifications of its own culture

94
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:16,380
and the demonizing of other cultures

95
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:31,940
So then, if we consider the cultures affected by the aggression of external factors

96
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:44,060
we go on encountering certain institutions, and social customs

97
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:48,400
that give cohesion to the affected peoples

98
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:56,860
with vindication and acts of revenge each time more violent

99
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:09,550
Therefore, the growing attacks of imperialism, which affirms its own “interests”

100
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:17,170
and with that it justifies the violence of one culture over others

101
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:24,390
correspond to an augmentation of the general violence of the cultures

102
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:28,040
that arise against those aggressors

103
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:35,100
that not only make a mistake regarding the planning of their profits and losses

104
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:44,400
but also ignore the procedures to retreat when it is already too late

105
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,610
HUMANISM AND THE CULTURAL THESIS

106
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:57,940
Universal Humanism must act in the different cultures

107
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:01,590
respecting the differences among them

108
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:08,850
respecting the cultural norms, customs and religions of each one

109
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:13,950
at the same time rejecting all discrimination

110
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:23,270
and affirming the freedom of the human being over its cultural characteristics

111
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:32,360
Universal Humanism must emphasize its conception over the distinct cultural theses

112
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:37,910
as stated at its origin

113
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:45,470
its missionary vocation in the different countries and cultures

114
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:49,950
has been a demonstration by example

115
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:59,050
even before the times when the malady of the current century began to unraveled

116
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:45,650
THE HUMANIST STATEMENT

117
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:50,250
to conclude

118
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:55,180
friends that are in the different Parks

119
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,530
to conclude

120
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:05,250
I want to remember the first words of the Humanist Document

121
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:10,730
that were formed on April 5th 1993

122
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:14,990
and surely they are relevant here

123
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:23,300
Humanists are women and men of this century, of this time

124
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:27,660
They recognize the achievements of humanism throughout history

125
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:32,240
and find inspiration in the contributions of many cultures

126
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:38,190
not only those that today occupy center stage

127
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:43,730
They are also men and women who recognize that this century and this millennium are drawing to a close

128
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:48,890
and their project is a new world

129
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:54,030
Humanists feel that their history is very long

130
00:20:54,030 --> 00:21:00,120
and that their future will be even longer.

131
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:06,420
As optimists who believe in freedom and social progress,

132
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:14,620
they fix their gaze on the future, while striving to overcome the general crisis of today

133
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:26,380
Humanists are internationalists, aspiring to a universal human nation

134
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:34,020
While understanding the world they live in as a single whole, humanists act in their immediate surroundings

135
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:43,360
Humanists seek not a uniform world but a world of multiplicity: diverse in ethnicity, languages and customs

136
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:50,580
diverse in local and regional autonomy; diverse in ideas and aspirations

137
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:54,640
diverse in beliefs, whether atheist or religious

138
00:21:54,650 --> 00:22:00,190
diverse in occupations and in creativity

139
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:04,670
Humanists do not want masters

140
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:09,950
they have no fondness for authority figures or bosses

141
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:17,530
Nor do they see themselves as representatives or bosses of anyone else

142
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:26,670
Humanists want neither a centralized State nor a Parastate in its place

143
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:35,790
Humanists want neither a police state nor armed gangs as the alternative

144
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:45,200
But a wall has arisen between humanist aspirations and the realities of today’s world

145
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,420
The time has come to tear down that wall

146
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:54,680
To do this, all humanists of the world must unite
