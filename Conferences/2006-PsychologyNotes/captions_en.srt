00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:33,142
Let us enter into our themeÖ

5
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:47,700
Is everybody ready?

6
00:00:48,033 --> 00:00:49,037
Yes!

7
00:00:51,005 --> 00:00:53,138
9:20

8
00:00:58,533 --> 00:00:59,542
letís start

9
00:01:02,007 --> 00:01:11,012
1. Impulses and the diversification of Impulses.

10
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:17,013
Ö here there is a problem of footnotes.

11
00:01:18,733 --> 00:01:23,600
We are not going to read all these footnotes because they are a bit heavyÖ

12
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:30,003
like lead, lead with zinc, pewter.

13
00:01:33,005 --> 00:01:36,014
Weíre not going to read them all, but some yes, two or three,

14
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:39,018
in order to illustrate the theme.

15
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:43,017
Well, letís get over with the prologue and in theme.

16
00:01:45,033 --> 00:01:46,600
In Psychology II it was stated

17
00:01:49,007 --> 00:01:55,008
that the work of an impulse, in whatever circuit,

18
00:02:00,004 --> 00:02:05,011
ends up producing an internal register in the subject.

19
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:11,500
One of the circuits deals with perception,

20
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:15,441
representation, a renewed taking of the representation,

21
00:02:16,005 --> 00:02:18,012
and the internal sensation in general.

22
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:21,300
Another circuit

23
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:24,010
traces the route of the impulses that end up

24
00:02:25,233 --> 00:02:28,900
in those actions launched towards the external worldó

25
00:02:28,009 --> 00:02:33,013
of which the subject also has internal sensation.

26
00:02:35,133 --> 00:02:38,700
Of the actions they launch towards the external world.

27
00:02:40,005 --> 00:02:43,838
This feedback of awareness is what allows one to learn

28
00:02:44,006 --> 00:02:48,014
through one's own actions, whether by improving on a previous action

29
00:02:49,004 --> 00:02:53,537
or by ruling out an error that has been committedÖ

30
00:02:53,933 --> 00:02:56,800
you understand thisÖ more or lessÖ

31
00:02:58,001 --> 00:03:02,007
All of this was made clearer through the example of learning to use a keyboard.

32
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:07,139
the c, d Ö oh, I made a mistake ñ isnít it?

33
00:03:08,005 --> 00:03:09,013
One is saying like thatÖ well

34
00:03:10,005 --> 00:03:15,005
Furthermore, every impulse whether it ends in the intrabody

35
00:03:16,004 --> 00:03:19,011
or the exterior of the body

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,001
produces registers of different placements in the space of representation.

37
00:03:27,005 --> 00:03:33,007
This makes it possible to point out that the impulses of the intrabodyÖ

38
00:03:35,004 --> 00:03:37,011
the impulses of the intrabody

39
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:47,009
locate themselves at the coenesthetic-tactile limit, towards the "inside" of the body,

40
00:03:48,005 --> 00:03:51,138
and that those impulses that terminate in actions in the external world

41
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:57,339
are registered at the kinesthetic-tactile limit,

42
00:03:59,033 --> 00:04:03,600
the kinesthetic-tactile limit towards the "outside".

43
00:04:03,006 --> 00:04:05,007
Whatever the direction of the impulse

44
00:04:05,007 --> 00:04:10,140
which necessarily counts on a correlate of information or internal sensation

45
00:04:11,004 --> 00:04:15,337
it will always modify the general state of the circuit.

46
00:04:17,004 --> 00:04:21,012
As regards the impulsesí capacity for transformation

47
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:26,100
we can consider two types:

48
00:04:26,001 --> 00:04:32,001
1. those capable of freeing tensions

49
00:04:32,007 --> 00:04:35,011
or of discharging psychophysical energy;

50
00:04:36,001 --> 00:04:40,010
that is, those we call ìcatharticî, cathartic impulses and

51
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,007
2. those which permit the transfer of internal charges, the integration of contents

52
00:04:47,007 --> 00:04:50,540
and the expansion of the possibilities for development of the psychophysical energy;

53
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:55,237
that is, those we call ìtransferentialî.

54
00:04:56,007 --> 00:04:59,040
Every impulse, then, independently of its direction,

55
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:03,600
has a predominantly cathartic or transferential capacity.

56
00:05:03,006 --> 00:05:09,012
Moreover, in every impulse there exists a quota of gratification or discomfort

57
00:05:10,002 --> 00:05:15,635
that permits the subjects to select

58
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:22,200
their acts of consciousness and corporal actions.

59
00:05:22,007 --> 00:05:27,140
The impulses "diversify" through various systems of feedback

60
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:33,500
such as those that permit comparisons of the registers of perceptions

61
00:05:33,008 --> 00:05:37,041
with the registers of representations

62
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:45,015
and with those that necessarily accompany "retentions" or memories of the same.

63
00:05:47,004 --> 00:05:51,437
Other kinds of diversifications exist that more or less voluntarily "focus"

64
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:55,000
on perceptions and representations.

65
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,004
These diversifications have been termed "apperceptions,"

66
00:06:00,008 --> 00:06:02,011
ìapperceptionsî

67
00:06:03,008 --> 00:06:07,011
that is to say, the selection and direction of the consciousness

68
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:13,008
towards the sources of perception and also "evocations",

69
00:06:14,133 --> 00:06:18,140
that is to say, the selection and direction of the consciousness

70
00:06:19,001 --> 00:06:22,004
towards the sources of retention.

71
00:06:23,005 --> 00:06:27,438
The voluntary and involuntary direction and selection of the consciousness

72
00:06:27,933 --> 00:06:31,600
towards its different sources constitutes the function

73
00:06:31,006 --> 00:06:35,013
that has generically been referred to as "attention".

74
00:06:38,005 --> 00:06:43,006
2. Consciousness, attention and the ìIî

75
00:06:46,633 --> 00:06:48,634
We term ìconsciousness,î

76
00:06:50,001 --> 00:06:54,134
the apparatus that coordinates and structures the sensations,

77
00:06:54,533 --> 00:06:57,600
images and memories of the human psychism.

78
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,333
Furthermore, it is not possible to locate the consciousness in a precise place

79
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:10,339
in the central nervous system or at a certain cortical or subcortical point or depth.

80
00:07:11,002 --> 00:07:15,007
It is also not a matter of confusing specialized points of work,

81
00:07:15,007 --> 00:07:17,015
such as the ìcentersî,

82
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:25,005
with the functional structures that can be verified throughout the totality of the nervous systemÖ

83
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,007
throughout the totality of the nervous system.

84
00:07:28,007 --> 00:07:30,440
For greater expository clarity,

85
00:07:31,133 --> 00:07:34,400
we designate as ìconscious phenomenaî

86
00:07:35,033 --> 00:07:41,300
all that occurs in the different levels and states of vigil,

87
00:07:41,006 --> 00:07:46,539
semisleep and sleep, including those which are subliminal

88
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:52,300
i.e. those which occur at the limits of registers whether perceived,

89
00:07:52,003 --> 00:07:55,036
represented or remembered.

90
00:07:55,333 --> 00:08:00,337
Of course, when speaking of the ìsubliminalî

91
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:08,400
we are not referring to those supposed ìsubconsciousî or ìunconsciousî.

92
00:08:08,008 --> 00:08:13,009
Often the consciousness is confused with the ìI,î

93
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:20,000
when in reality the latter doesnít have a corporeal base,

94
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:25,700
as does the consciousness, which though may be diffuse, does have a corporeal base,

95
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,333
does have a physical base,

96
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:32,010
Ö but it seems the I is another storyÖ

97
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,002
as occurs with that which can be identified as the registering

98
00:08:43,002 --> 00:08:46,003
and coordinating "apparatus" of the human psychism.

99
00:08:46,533 --> 00:08:48,700
We previously stated that:

100
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:53,500
ìÖThis register of the own identity of the consciousness

101
00:08:53,005 --> 00:08:56,008
is given by the data of the senses, the data of memory,

102
00:08:56,008 --> 00:09:04,941
and a peculiar configuration that gives to the consciousness the illusion of permanence,

103
00:09:05,733 --> 00:09:11,200
in spite of the continual changes that it can verify within itself.

104
00:09:12,004 --> 00:09:19,007
This illusory configuration of identity and permanence is the "Iî.

105
00:09:22,001 --> 00:09:25,001
It is frequently seen in altered states of consciousness,

106
00:09:25,001 --> 00:09:28,005
that while the consciousness maintains itself in vigil, specific impulses

107
00:09:28,005 --> 00:09:32,013
that should arrive as registers are blocked,

108
00:09:33,003 --> 00:09:38,011
and the notion of the ìIî undergoes an alteration or an estrangement.

109
00:09:40,004 --> 00:09:41,004
In this situation,

110
00:09:41,004 --> 00:09:46,004
the ìIî is registered as located in the external limit-zones

111
00:09:46,004 --> 00:09:52,009
of the space of representation and at a certain ìdistanceî from the habitual ìIî

112
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:54,010
Ö distance in quotations marks.

113
00:09:56,433 --> 00:10:01,436
The subject can experience themselves

114
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:06,600
registering and feeling phenomena that come from the external world

115
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:10,011
although, rigorously speaking, these are not phenomena of perception

116
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,342
but rather representation.

117
00:10:14,005 --> 00:10:18,738
These phenomena, where representation is substituted for perception

118
00:10:19,233 --> 00:10:24,100
and as such located within an ìexternal spaceî

119
00:10:24,001 --> 00:10:30,434
towards whose limit the ìIî moves, we refer to as ìprojectionsî.

120
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:40,600
3. Spatiality and temporality of the phenomena of consciousness

121
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:48,341
In active vigil, the ìIî locates itself in the more external zones of the space of representation,Ö

122
00:10:50,008 --> 00:10:52,010
I see you! Do you exist?

123
00:10:56,233 --> 00:10:57,500
Hallucination!

124
00:10:59,008 --> 00:11:05,009
In active vigil, the ìIî locates itself in the more external zones of the space of representation,

125
00:11:06,002 --> 00:11:11,008
ìlostî in the limits of external sense of touch,

126
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:14,007
but if I have an apperception of something that I see,

127
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:19,440
the register of the ìIî shifts.

128
00:11:23,006 --> 00:11:26,008
In this moment I could say to myself:

129
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:36,001
ìFrom where I am I see an external object that I register within my bodyî.

130
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:44,842
Even though I am connected with the external world through the senses

131
00:11:46,001 --> 00:11:56,034
there exists a division between spaces, and it is in the internal space that I locate the ìIî.

132
00:11:59,007 --> 00:12:02,011
If I subsequently have an apperception of my breathing

133
00:12:04,004 --> 00:12:05,011
I might say to myselfÖ

134
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:10,335
parenthesis (this is what I say to myself):

135
00:12:11,008 --> 00:12:16,011
ìI experience within me the movement of my lungs.

136
00:12:20,002 --> 00:12:26,008
I am inside my body but I am not inside my lungsî.

137
00:12:28,004 --> 00:12:34,337
It is clear that I register a distance between the ìIî and the lungs,

138
00:12:35,008 --> 00:12:41,008
not only because I register the ìIî in the head which is far from the thoracic cage

139
00:12:42,002 --> 00:12:44,735
but because in all cases of internal perception,

140
00:12:45,004 --> 00:12:49,437
as may occur with a toothache or headache,

141
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,009
these registers will always be at a ìdistanceî,

142
00:12:54,002 --> 00:12:58,002
at a ìdistanceî from me as observer.

143
00:13:02,007 --> 00:13:11,240
But here we are not interested in this ìdistanceî between me and the object,

144
00:13:12,002 --> 00:13:13,002
rather what we are interested in

145
00:13:13,002 --> 00:13:16,005
is the ìdistanceî from the ìIî towards the external world

146
00:13:16,005 --> 00:13:20,008
and from the ìIî towards the internal world.

147
00:13:21,006 --> 00:13:23,007
In both directions there is a distance,

148
00:13:23,007 --> 00:13:27,940
and weíre interested in this distance, in that it presents itself and speaksÖ

149
00:13:29,533 --> 00:13:33,200
Certainly we could point out very subtle

150
00:13:33,002 --> 00:13:36,009
nuances in the variability of the ìspatialî positions of the ìIî,

151
00:13:36,009 --> 00:13:37,014
but here we are highlighting

152
00:13:38,004 --> 00:13:42,137
the diametrical locations of the ìIî in each of the mentioned cases.

153
00:13:42,008 --> 00:13:45,011
In this description, we can also say that the ìIî

154
00:13:46,001 --> 00:13:50,234
can be located in the interior of the space of representation

155
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:52,442
but in the kinesthetic tactile limits

156
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,600
that give the notion of the external world and inversely,

157
00:13:56,833 --> 00:14:03,400
in the coenesthetic tactile limits that give the notion of the internal world.

158
00:14:06,033 --> 00:14:11,041
In any case, we can use the image of a biconcave film

159
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,008
as the limit between worlds,

160
00:14:17,001 --> 00:14:21,006
a biconcave film as the limit between worlds

161
00:14:21,009 --> 00:14:24,010
that dilates or contracts,

162
00:14:25,433 --> 00:14:34,500
and in this way focuses or blurs the register of external and internal objects.

163
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:39,007
The attention is directed more or less intentionally

164
00:14:39,007 --> 00:14:43,014
towards the registers of the external or internal senses in vigil.

165
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:48,400
This management of its direction is lost in semisleep,

166
00:14:48,008 --> 00:14:52,008
sleep or even in altered states of vigil

167
00:14:53,033 --> 00:14:55,000
since in all these levels and states

168
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,009
reversibility is affected by phenomena and registers that are imposed on the consciousness.

169
00:15:02,006 --> 00:15:08,011
It is very evident that in the constitution of the ìIî are taking part not only memory,

170
00:15:09,001 --> 00:15:11,008
perception and representation

171
00:15:12,033 --> 00:15:17,500
but also the position of the attention in the space of representation.

172
00:15:18,004 --> 00:15:22,237
Consequently, we are not speaking about a substantial ìIî

173
00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:28,015
but rather an epiphenomena of the activity of the consciousness.

174
00:15:30,005 --> 00:15:32,938
This ìI - attentionî

175
00:15:33,007 --> 00:15:36,010
seems to carry out the function of coordinating the activities of the consciousness

176
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,733
with oneís own body and with the world in general.

177
00:15:43,002 --> 00:15:47,005
The registers of the position and elapsing of mental phenomena

178
00:15:47,005 --> 00:15:54,009
overlap in, and also become independent of, this mental coordination.

179
00:15:55,001 --> 00:16:00,006
In this way, the metaphor of the ìIî ends up taking on identity

180
00:16:01,933 --> 00:16:03,933
as if it existed

181
00:16:06,004 --> 00:16:12,237
and ìsubstantiality,î becoming independent of the structure of the functions of the consciousness.

182
00:16:13,002 --> 00:16:19,002
On the other hand, the repeated registers and recognition of the action of attention

183
00:16:19,005 --> 00:16:21,938
goes being configured in the human being from very early

184
00:16:22,433 --> 00:16:27,200
on in the measure that the child arranges more or less voluntary

185
00:16:27,002 --> 00:16:31,002
directions towards the external world and towards the intrabody.

186
00:16:31,433 --> 00:16:37,500
Gradually, along with the management of the body and certain internal functions,

187
00:16:38,003 --> 00:16:41,336
the punctual presence is strengthened

188
00:16:41,009 --> 00:16:47,012
as is a copresence in which the register of oneís own ìIî is constituted

189
00:16:48,433 --> 00:16:55,500
as concentrator and background of all mental activity.

190
00:16:56,001 --> 00:17:02,234
We are in the presence of the great illusion of the consciousness which we call ìIî.

191
00:17:03,433 --> 00:17:08,440
We should now consider the location of the ìIî in the different levels of consciousness.

192
00:17:09,004 --> 00:17:15,011
In vigil the ìIî occupies a central position

193
00:17:16,008 --> 00:17:21,541
given by the availability of the attention and reversibility.

194
00:17:23,533 --> 00:17:26,700
This varies considerably in semisleep,

195
00:17:26,009 --> 00:17:28,942
when the impulses that come from the external senses

196
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:35,837
tend to become weakened or fluctuate between the external world and a generalized coenesthesia.

197
00:17:37,001 --> 00:17:41,634
It is during sleep with images that the ìIî internalizes itself.

198
00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:49,141
Lastly, it is in vegetative sleep that the register of the ìIî disappears.

199
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:55,007
A footnote: In the ìparadoxal dreamî or dream with images,

200
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,008
the register of the ìIî becomes ìdistantî from the external world

201
00:17:59,008 --> 00:18:03,008
and dilutes itself in unconnected images to the point of disappearing

202
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,004
in a situation which is difficult to control for the dreamer.

203
00:18:09,008 --> 00:18:11,016
In terms of deep vegetative sleep,

204
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:18,642
electroencelographics show a complete lack of images.

205
00:18:20,001 --> 00:18:24,008
Neither can REM (Rapid Eye Movement) be verified,

206
00:18:24,008 --> 00:18:27,009
which coincides with a later forgetting of the psychic events

207
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:34,014
that occurred in a total forgetting of the ìIî.

208
00:18:39,009 --> 00:18:42,442
The transformations of the impulses in vigilic reveries

209
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:46,334
appear in the sequences of free association

210
00:18:46,733 --> 00:18:50,700
with numerous allegorical, symbolic and signic translations

211
00:18:50,007 --> 00:18:55,012
that make up the special language of the images of the coenesthesia.

212
00:18:56,933 --> 00:19:01,937
Of course we are referring to the uncontrolled sequences of images

213
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,933
typical of the associative pathways and not to the imaginary constructions,

214
00:19:07,933 --> 00:19:10,600
not to the imaginary constructions

215
00:19:11,033 --> 00:19:15,700
that follow a, more or less, premeditated development,

216
00:19:15,009 --> 00:19:18,016
nor are we referring to the translation of impulses channeled through the abstractive paths

217
00:19:19,006 --> 00:19:23,139
which also are manifested as symbolical and signic images.

218
00:19:24,133 --> 00:19:27,400
Impulses, transforming themselves in different levels

219
00:19:27,004 --> 00:19:30,005
also cause the register of the ìIî

220
00:19:30,008 --> 00:19:35,008
to vary in depth and superficiality in the space of representation.

221
00:19:36,001 --> 00:19:37,003
To sketch this out

222
00:19:37,003 --> 00:19:41,009
we could point out that psychic phenomena are always registered

223
00:19:42,003 --> 00:19:48,011
not only between the ìspatialî coordinates x and y

224
00:19:49,001 --> 00:19:52,234
but also in respect to z;

225
00:19:52,006 --> 00:19:58,011
ìzî being the depth of the register in the space of representation.

226
00:19:59,007 --> 00:20:02,011
Of course the register of any phenomenon

227
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:08,007
is experienced in the tridimensionality of the space of representation

228
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:20,001
according its greater externality or interiority with respect to the impulsesí depth,

229
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:25,002
vertical height, and horizontal lateral position

230
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:29,433
ósomething that can be verified through apperception or representing impulses

231
00:20:29,433 --> 00:20:38,300
originating from the external world, the intrabody or the memory.

232
00:20:38,009 --> 00:20:40,018
Avoiding the complications of the descriptions proper to Phenomenology

233
00:20:41,008 --> 00:20:47,009
we should now consider some topics which it has exhaustively studied.

234
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:51,839
We say that in vigil the fields of presence and copresence

235
00:20:52,433 --> 00:20:58,434
allow us to locate phenomena within a temporal succession,

236
00:20:59,004 --> 00:21:01,004
establishing the relation of events

237
00:21:01,004 --> 00:21:04,837
from the present moment where I am located

238
00:21:05,005 --> 00:21:09,010
along with previous moments from which the flow of my consciousness comes

239
00:21:10,003 --> 00:21:16,336
as well as subsequent moments, to which this flow is directed.

240
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:27,500
In any case, the present instant is the barrier of temporality

241
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,007
and even though I cannot give an account of it

242
00:21:29,007 --> 00:21:34,013
because when I think about it I count only on the retention of what has happened

243
00:21:35,006 --> 00:21:36,439
in the dynamic of my consciousness,

244
00:21:37,033 --> 00:21:45,000
its apparent "fixity" permits me to go ìbackì toward the phenomena that are no longer

245
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
and ìforwardî toward those that are not yet.

246
00:21:50,004 --> 00:21:53,005
It is in the temporal horizon of the consciousness

247
00:21:53,005 --> 00:21:56,010
that all events are recorded.

248
00:21:57,009 --> 00:22:02,009
And in the restricted horizon that fixes the presence of acts and objects

249
00:22:03,133 --> 00:22:06,300
a field of copresence will always be acting

250
00:22:06,003 --> 00:22:10,005
in which everything will be connected.

251
00:22:11,933 --> 00:22:17,800
This is different from what occurs in the elapsing of the physical world;

252
00:22:19,006 --> 00:22:25,008
events of consciousness do not respect chronological succession,

253
00:22:26,006 --> 00:22:33,007
rather they turn back, persist, become actualized, modified and futurized,

254
00:22:33,007 --> 00:22:36,540
altering the present instant.

255
00:22:38,005 --> 00:22:41,638
The ìpresent instantî

256
00:22:43,004 --> 00:22:47,013
is structured by the intercrossing of the retention and the protention.

257
00:22:48,003 --> 00:22:49,007
For example:

258
00:22:50,003 --> 00:22:55,007
a painful event imagined in the future

259
00:22:58,433 --> 00:23:03,800
can act over the subjectís present;

260
00:23:05,233 --> 00:23:07,236
diverting the tendency that has moved his body

261
00:23:07,533 --> 00:23:11,900
in the direction of a previously desired object.

262
00:23:13,033 --> 00:23:20,000
In this way, the laws that serve in the spatio-temporality of the physical world

263
00:23:20,004 --> 00:23:26,005
are considerably diverted in mental objects and acts.

264
00:23:27,033 --> 00:23:32,039
This independence of the psychism, through ìdeviationî of the physical laws,

265
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,009
brings to mind the idea of ìclinamenî

266
00:23:37,133 --> 00:23:39,000
ìclinamenî

267
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:50,100
which Epicurus presented in order to introduce freedom into a world dominated by mechanism.

268
00:23:50,933 --> 00:23:52,300
Footnote:

269
00:23:53,005 --> 00:23:55,013
It seems that Epicurus defended Democritus' Theory

270
00:23:56,533 --> 00:24:01,400
according to which atoms in motion form the physical world.

271
00:24:01,004 --> 00:24:04,007
However, he added in response to an objection of Aristotleís,

272
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,008
that the atoms suffer deviations, and inclinations,

273
00:24:08,008 --> 00:24:11,010
which permit their encounters.

274
00:24:13,633 --> 00:24:17,500
The doctrine pertaining to the idea of the ìclinamenî,

275
00:24:17,733 --> 00:24:21,736
doesnít seem to have been fully formulated until three hundred years after Epicurus.

276
00:24:22,003 --> 00:24:24,436
See: Lucrectius De Rerum Natura, thisÖ

277
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:31,033
well, but this is an interesting subject...

278
00:24:31,033 --> 00:24:35,300
Taking as understood the structurality of the consciousness

279
00:24:35,003 --> 00:24:40,836
in relation to the ìapparatusesî and the different pathways through which the impulse circulates,

280
00:24:41,133 --> 00:24:46,200
we can consider this, the impulse, in its various transformations,

281
00:24:46,005 --> 00:24:52,008
as the basic ìatomî of psychic activity, the impulse.

282
00:24:54,009 --> 00:24:59,742
However, this atom does not present itself in isolation but rather in ìimpulse trainsî,

283
00:25:02,006 --> 00:25:08,008
in configurations that give rise to perception, memory and representation.

284
00:25:09,033 --> 00:25:11,400
In this way,

285
00:25:12,002 --> 00:25:16,010
the insertion of the psychic in external spatiality

286
00:25:17,233 --> 00:25:23,400
begins with the impulses which become protentions of kinesthetic images,

287
00:25:23,633 --> 00:25:28,300
futurizations, in that what I am going to do nowÖ

288
00:25:29,002 --> 00:25:31,002
become protentions of kinesthetic images

289
00:25:31,002 --> 00:25:37,735
and move towards the exterior of the tridimensionality of the space of representation,

290
00:25:38,007 --> 00:25:42,007
moving the body, moving the body.

291
00:25:44,233 --> 00:25:50,800
It is clear that the coenesthetic images and those corresponding to external senses

292
00:25:50,008 --> 00:25:53,017
act in an auxiliary mode, as ìcompounded signalsî,

293
00:25:54,007 --> 00:25:57,140
PiroÖ as compounded signals,

294
00:25:58,733 --> 00:26:07,737
in all phenomena in which the selecting and regulating of motor direction and intensity are involved.

295
00:26:10,633 --> 00:26:16,800
Finally, it is in this flow of impulses relative to the time and space of the consciousness

296
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:20,341
that the first events occur that will end up modifying the world.

297
00:26:25,009 --> 00:26:30,009
At this point it would not be out of place to make a general reflection

298
00:26:31,002 --> 00:26:37,635
about the events in which the psychism acts from, and toward, its externality.

299
00:26:38,001 --> 00:26:41,004
To begin with, we observe that material objects

300
00:26:41,006 --> 00:26:47,014
are presented as spatiality to the ìtactileî reception of the senses,

301
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:53,008
to the ìtactileî reception of the senses, of all of the senses

302
00:26:57,001 --> 00:27:03,002
which differentiates the corpuscle, the corpuscle,

303
00:27:03,006 --> 00:27:15,773
the wave, the molecule, pressure, temperature, etc.

304
00:27:18,533 --> 00:27:26,267
Spatial phenomena which is registered as tactile in all of the senses.

305
00:27:28,233 --> 00:27:32,241
To round it up, we say that these ìimpressionsî, or impulses external to the psychism,

306
00:27:33,033 --> 00:27:36,036
put into motion a system of interpretation and response

307
00:27:36,006 --> 00:27:40,839
that could not operate if it wasnít for an internal space.

308
00:27:41,007 --> 00:27:44,740
So that the world moves my internal spaceÖ

309
00:27:45,008 --> 00:27:47,841
It doesn't stop here

310
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:59,000
In what part of my internal space moves the world and if we don't see it...

311
00:27:59,008 --> 00:28:05,041
We are affirming, in the broadest possible way, that by variation of impulses between ìspacesî,

312
00:28:06,001 --> 00:28:10,434
as if there would be nothing but spaces and impulses, what is thisÖ

313
00:28:10,008 --> 00:28:10,017
wellÖ

314
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,007
Weíre affirming in the broadest possible way that by variation of impulses between ìspacesî

315
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,733
the psychism is penetrated by, and penetrates, the world.

316
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,933
We are not speaking of closed circuits between stimulus and response,

317
00:28:28,933 --> 00:28:30,935
Pavlov, no,

318
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,133
but rather of an open and growing system that grasps and acts

319
00:28:37,004 --> 00:28:40,012
through accumulation and temporal protention.

320
00:28:42,004 --> 00:28:44,013
On the other hand, this ìopeningî,

321
00:28:45,003 --> 00:28:48,012
this ìopeningî, this ìopeningî

322
00:28:49,002 --> 00:28:55,011
between ìspacesî does not occur through crossing the barriers of a monad

323
00:28:56,007 --> 00:29:06,013
but rather because the consciousness from its origin is constituted from, in, and for, the world.

324
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,003
Footnote:

325
00:29:10,008 --> 00:29:13,013
Since Pythagoras the monad has been conceived as the primary

326
00:29:14,003 --> 00:29:18,011
or fundamental unit from which numbers are derived.(their things)

327
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:22,442
Through the years, the idea of the monad underwent important changes

328
00:29:23,007 --> 00:29:27,014
until, in the Renaissance and with Giordano Brunoís Of Monads,

329
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:33,800
the constitutive atoms of reality are living and animated.

330
00:29:34,009 --> 00:29:38,014
In the XVIII Century Leibniz in his Principles of Nature,

331
00:29:39,004 --> 00:29:42,010
characterizes the monads as ìatomsî

332
00:29:43,233 --> 00:29:48,800
without beginning or end that combine without interpenetrating

333
00:29:49,001 --> 00:29:51,334
and which possess their own force.

334
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:55,840
Contemporaneously, Kant in his Monadology describes the monad

335
00:29:56,533 --> 00:30:04,100
as an indivisible point, as opposed to the space that is infinitely divisible.

336
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:06,008
WellÖ

337
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:08,339
Well.

338
00:30:16,006 --> 00:30:19,008
On the other hand, this ìopeningî between ìspacesî does not occur

339
00:30:19,008 --> 00:30:22,341
through crossing the barriers of a monad but rather because the consciousness

340
00:30:23,133 --> 00:30:29,200
from its origin is constituted from, in, and for, the world.

341
00:30:36,007 --> 00:30:38,640
4. Structure of the consciousness.

342
00:30:39,008 --> 00:30:41,341
Well, that more or less was the clocksmithÖ

343
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:46,134
now structure of the consciousness, structure of the consciousness

344
00:30:46,007 --> 00:30:51,040
The different ways of being a human being in the world.

345
00:30:53,233 --> 00:30:58,300
The different ways of being a human being in the world,

346
00:30:58,008 --> 00:31:02,013
understanding world as the synthesis of internal and externalÖ

347
00:31:03,633 --> 00:31:06,500
The different ways of being a human being in the world,

348
00:31:06,008 --> 00:31:09,014
the various circumstances of experience and doing,

349
00:31:10,633 --> 00:31:15,200
correspond to complete structurings of the consciousness.

350
00:31:16,005 --> 00:31:19,011
Thus: the "unhappy consciousness",

351
00:31:20,008 --> 00:31:22,941
the "anguished consciousness",

352
00:31:24,333 --> 00:31:27,200
the ìemotional consciousness",

353
00:31:27,533 --> 00:31:29,600
the "disgusted consciousness",

354
00:31:30,007 --> 00:31:33,008
the "nauseated consciousness",

355
00:31:34,002 --> 00:31:35,835
the "inspired consciousness",

356
00:31:36,033 --> 00:31:40,600
are prominent cases that have been well described.

357
00:31:40,006 --> 00:31:40,015
Footnote:

358
00:31:41,005 --> 00:31:42,011
In his Phenomenology of the Spirit Hegel

359
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,006
refers to ìalienationî as the ìunhappy consciousnessî

360
00:31:51,006 --> 00:31:56,239
which is registered as consciousness tearing at itself

361
00:31:57,001 --> 00:32:03,008
so it is found separated from, and dispossessed of, the reality to which it belongs.

362
00:32:03,008 --> 00:32:05,010
How interesting!

363
00:32:07,233 --> 00:32:10,500
In The Concept of Dread, Kierkegaard

364
00:32:10,005 --> 00:32:13,011
studied the ìanguished consciousnessî

365
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:17,800
the ìanguished consciousnessî

366
00:32:19,009 --> 00:32:24,016
which manifests with regards to its object that is ìnothingnessî.

367
00:32:27,001 --> 00:32:30,010
Many ìphilosophers of existenceî

368
00:32:32,002 --> 00:32:34,035
draw on the phenomenological method

369
00:32:34,233 --> 00:32:39,300
to describe the acts and objects of consciousnessí synthesis.

370
00:32:40,004 --> 00:32:43,009
Sartre in his Outline of a Theory of Emotions

371
00:32:43,009 --> 00:32:46,342
describes ìemotional consciousnessî

372
00:32:47,233 --> 00:32:54,400
and Kolnai in On Disgust describes the ìconsciousness of disgustî

373
00:32:56,002 --> 00:32:58,002
Ö well.

374
00:32:58,006 --> 00:33:00,639
It is pertinent to note here

375
00:33:01,005 --> 00:33:09,438
that such descriptions can apply to the personal, the groupal and the social.

376
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,033
For example, to describe a structure of consciousness in panic,

377
00:33:17,003 --> 00:33:19,007
in panic,

378
00:33:20,001 --> 00:33:23,009
one should begin from the collective situation,

379
00:33:23,009 --> 00:33:30,542
as is recognized in the (legendary and historic) origins of the word ìpanicî

380
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:35,014
that designates a special state of consciousness.

381
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:41,336
With the passage of time the word ìpanicî

382
00:33:41,633 --> 00:33:46,700
has come to be used with increasing frequency to explain an alteration of individual consciousness.

383
00:33:46,007 --> 00:33:47,010
Note:

384
00:33:48,006 --> 00:33:50,013
PanÖ Pan, the god Pan

385
00:33:51,533 --> 00:33:55,534
was a beneficent, pre-Hellenic divinity

386
00:33:55,633 --> 00:34:01,100
of the shepherds, fields and flocks.

387
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:05,336
In one legend he appears during the battle of Marathon

388
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:09,842
sowing ìterror and panicî among the Persians

389
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,002
and helping the Athenians

390
00:34:13,002 --> 00:34:17,009
who, starting at that moment, spread his worship throughout Greece.

391
00:34:17,009 --> 00:34:23,013
The adjective ìpanicî refers to the divinity in general,

392
00:34:24,003 --> 00:34:26,236
panic, what was done by Pan

393
00:34:32,006 --> 00:34:35,014
but ìpanicî is also used to denote the collective and contagious state of consciousness,

394
00:34:36,004 --> 00:34:42,012
that indicates an imminent danger.

395
00:34:45,002 --> 00:34:46,011
This is the panic.

396
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:54,300
At present Psychiatry has coined the term ìpanic syndromeî,

397
00:34:54,533 --> 00:34:58,500
weakening the initial collective meaning.

398
00:34:58,008 --> 00:34:59,012
All rightÖ fine.

399
00:35:07,006 --> 00:35:08,006
However,

400
00:35:08,933 --> 00:35:11,938
the previously cited cases can be understood individually

401
00:35:12,007 --> 00:35:18,240
or as an assembleage (in consideration of the intersubjectivity constitutive of the consciousness).

402
00:35:19,003 --> 00:35:23,004
Variations in these global structures always occur

403
00:35:23,633 --> 00:35:27,400
and will occur in the concurrent phenomena

404
00:35:27,633 --> 00:35:32,100
as is the case of the ìIî.

405
00:35:32,007 --> 00:35:36,012
Thus, in full vigil but in different states of consciousness

406
00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:43,005
we register the location of the ìIî in different depths of the space of representation.

407
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:46,335
To understand the foregoing,

408
00:35:46,533 --> 00:35:50,500
we must appeal to the differences between levels and states of consciousness.

409
00:35:50,005 --> 00:35:51,013
The classical levels of vigil, semisleep,

410
00:35:52,005 --> 00:35:55,009
deep paradoxical sleep and deep vegetative sleep,

411
00:35:55,009 --> 00:35:57,013
do not present difficulties of comprehension.

412
00:35:58,006 --> 00:36:01,008
But in each one of those levels we have the possibility of recognizing

413
00:36:02,001 --> 00:36:05,005
different positions of the psychic phenomena.

414
00:36:05,007 --> 00:36:07,015
Taking some extreme examples

415
00:36:08,008 --> 00:36:15,013
we say that when the ìIî maintains sensory contact with the external world

416
00:36:16,006 --> 00:36:21,239
but is lost among its representations and evocations,

417
00:36:22,004 --> 00:36:27,009
or if it is aware of itself without significant interest in its actions in the world,

418
00:36:28,002 --> 00:36:35,008
we are in the presence of a vigilic consciousness in the state of absorption.

419
00:36:37,633 --> 00:36:44,000
The body acts externally in a sort of ìirrealityî

420
00:36:44,005 --> 00:36:49,838
that on being deepened can end up in disconnection and immobility.

421
00:36:50,009 --> 00:36:53,042
It is a matter of the ìIî slipping

422
00:36:54,003 --> 00:37:00,012
towards a constant presence of registers of evocation,

423
00:37:01,005 --> 00:37:05,010
representation or tactile coenesthetic perception and therefore

424
00:37:06,003 --> 00:37:11,011
the distance between the ìIî and the external object is ìincreasedî.

425
00:37:12,004 --> 00:37:14,837
The distance increases.

426
00:37:15,008 --> 00:37:16,014
Fine.

427
00:37:18,933 --> 00:37:20,100
In the opposite case

428
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:23,100
the ìIî lost in the external world

429
00:37:25,006 --> 00:37:29,139
displaces itself towards the tactile kinesthetic registers

430
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,007
with neither criticism nor reversibility towards the acts being carried out.

431
00:37:36,433 --> 00:37:43,100
Here we are dealing with a case of vigilic consciousness in a state of alteration

432
00:37:44,002 --> 00:37:47,935
as can occur in what are called ìviolent emotionsî.

433
00:37:50,004 --> 00:37:55,006
In this case, what is decisive is the importance

434
00:37:55,833 --> 00:38:01,842
with which the external object is charged, shortening the distance between the ìIî and the perceived object.

435
00:38:05,433 --> 00:38:12,400
a. Structures, states and non-habitual cases of consciousness.

436
00:38:13,007 --> 00:38:17,013
We call as ìnon-habitualî those behaviors that present abnormalities

437
00:38:18,003 --> 00:38:24,012
with respect to the individual or group parameters under consideration.

438
00:38:25,005 --> 00:38:31,938
It is clear that if the population of a country, or a human group,

439
00:38:32,733 --> 00:38:39,000
goes mad we are not going to cease considering these to be cases of ìnon-habitualî behaviors

440
00:38:39,004 --> 00:38:44,005
just because of the number of representatives.

441
00:38:44,933 --> 00:38:47,100
In any case,

442
00:38:47,004 --> 00:38:56,010
that human collective should be compared with stable situations in which it has lived

443
00:38:57,002 --> 00:39:02,003
and where reversibility, the critical sense and control of its acts,

444
00:39:02,533 --> 00:39:04,800
has predictable characteristics.

445
00:39:05,001 --> 00:39:08,006
On the other hand there are ìnon-habitualî cases that are fleeting

446
00:39:09,003 --> 00:39:17,836
and others that seem more rooted or even unfold as time passes.

447
00:39:18,009 --> 00:39:22,016
It is not our interest to typify those social conducts

448
00:39:23,006 --> 00:39:28,007
from the point of view of the law, the economy, or of psychiatry.

449
00:39:30,004 --> 00:39:33,237
Perhaps we could find more motives for reflection

450
00:39:33,633 --> 00:39:38,639
on these cases in anthropology or history...

451
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:45,000
If our interest in ìnon-habitualî behaviors

452
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,002
carries us to the field of the personal,

453
00:39:49,433 --> 00:39:54,000
or at the most to that of the immediate interpersonal,

454
00:39:54,233 --> 00:39:58,241
the criteria of reversibility,

455
00:39:59,003 --> 00:40:02,006
critical sense and control of oneís own acts

456
00:40:03,002 --> 00:40:07,735
will continue being valid in relation to that personal or interpersonal history.

457
00:40:08,333 --> 00:40:10,338
What was mentioned earlier is still applicable

458
00:40:10,833 --> 00:40:13,800
in regards to those fleeting ìnon-habitualî cases,

459
00:40:14,033 --> 00:40:17,300
both those that seem established as well as those which will unfold

460
00:40:17,005 --> 00:40:21,011
in their abnormality as time passes.

461
00:40:22,008 --> 00:40:26,017
Therefore we carry our study of the ìnon-habitualî

462
00:40:27,933 --> 00:40:31,400
out of the territory of pathology to focus

463
00:40:31,006 --> 00:40:36,010
it within our Psychology, in two large groups of states and cases;

464
00:40:37,002 --> 00:40:42,002
those that we call respectively, ìperturbed consciousnessî

465
00:40:42,005 --> 00:40:47,009
and ìinspired consciousnessî.

466
00:40:48,001 --> 00:40:51,005
b. ìPerturbed consciousnessî.

467
00:40:55,004 --> 00:41:05,004
There exist diametric positions of the ìIî:

468
00:41:06,007 --> 00:41:09,014
between altered states that range from everyday activity

469
00:41:10,004 --> 00:41:13,005
to violent emotion and between states of absorption

470
00:41:13,733 --> 00:41:19,700
that range from reflective calm to the disconnection of the external world.

471
00:41:22,267 --> 00:41:25,268
There are also altered states in which the representations

472
00:41:25,006 --> 00:41:30,539
are externalized as projections in such a way that they are fed back to the consciousness

473
00:41:31,004 --> 00:41:34,010
as ìperceptionsî originating in the external world.

474
00:41:35,233 --> 00:41:39,400
There are other states of absorption, in which the perception of the external world

475
00:41:39,967 --> 00:41:42,972
is internalizedóintrojected.

476
00:41:44,433 --> 00:41:50,100
We have read and listened to well researched accounts and reports

477
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:53,900
of individuals who suffered hallucinations

478
00:41:53,009 --> 00:41:58,742
while in difficult situations in high mountains,

479
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,133
in polar solitudes, in deserts and at sea.

480
00:42:06,333 --> 00:42:09,867
The physical state of fatigue, anoxia and thirst;

481
00:42:10,004 --> 00:42:15,371
the psychic state of abandonment in the monotony of silence and solitude;

482
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:18,142
the extreme thermal environmental conditions,

483
00:42:19,633 --> 00:42:24,640
these are elements that can cause cases of hallucinatory alterations

484
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:30,676
or, more frequently, cases of specific illusory alterations.

485
00:42:32,433 --> 00:42:38,167
On the other hand, on the side of introjected absorption,

486
00:42:38,533 --> 00:42:40,542
the external sensation arrives to the consciousness

487
00:42:41,667 --> 00:42:43,300
but the corresponding representation

488
00:42:43,533 --> 00:42:47,540
operates disconnectedly from the general perceptual context,

489
00:42:48,005 --> 00:42:51,338
feeding back to the consciousness which interprets and registers the phenomenon

490
00:42:52,001 --> 00:42:55,334
as ìmeaningfulî interiority,

491
00:42:55,967 --> 00:43:01,133
as a representation which appears ìto direct itselfî to the interior of the subject in a direct fashion.

492
00:43:02,433 --> 00:43:03,367
For example:

493
00:43:04,033 --> 00:43:08,036
the colored lights of the traffic signals in a big city

494
00:43:10,533 --> 00:43:15,000
suddenly begin to ìsendî mysterious codes

495
00:43:16,967 --> 00:43:20,973
and clues to the eyes of an anxious pedestrian who,

496
00:43:22,009 --> 00:43:23,016
starting from this moment,

497
00:43:24,006 --> 00:43:29,273
considers themselves as the only person capable of ìreceivingî and understanding

498
00:43:30,067 --> 00:43:32,074
the significance of the messages.

499
00:43:38,233 --> 00:43:41,300
Projected altered states,

500
00:43:42,867 --> 00:43:46,000
as well as the introjected states of absorption,

501
00:43:46,003 --> 00:43:51,136
correspond to the transitory or permanent perturbation of vigilic consciousness

502
00:43:51,007 --> 00:43:55,012
which we have mentioned here as cases of diametric placement

503
00:43:56,433 --> 00:43:58,867
in the location of the ìIî.

504
00:43:59,007 --> 00:44:01,340
Furthermore, we should also mention

505
00:44:02,033 --> 00:44:07,100
the states of alteration and absorption in the level of sleep with images,

506
00:44:07,001 --> 00:44:08,834
and semisleep.

507
00:44:09,006 --> 00:44:11,239
In Psychology III we reviewed

508
00:44:12,033 --> 00:44:15,867
numerous cases of transitory perturbations of the consciousness.

509
00:44:17,009 --> 00:44:21,076
We mentioned the situation of a person who projects their internal representations

510
00:44:22,433 --> 00:44:25,200
and is left very suggestible to them,

511
00:44:25,567 --> 00:44:27,574
in a similar fashion to what occurs in full sleep

512
00:44:28,005 --> 00:44:31,012
when one receives the suggestions of oneiric images.

513
00:44:33,167 --> 00:44:38,172
This refers to hallucinations which also occur in states of intense fever;

514
00:44:39,004 --> 00:44:42,013
chemical action (gases, drugs, and alcohol);

515
00:44:43,733 --> 00:44:49,734
mechanical action (spinning, forced breathing, pressure on arteries);

516
00:44:50,005 --> 00:44:54,009
by suppression of the external senses (isolation chamber)

517
00:44:55,467 --> 00:45:00,733
and by the suppression of internal senses (astronauts in zero gravity).

518
00:45:04,567 --> 00:45:08,500
We should also consider accidental perturbations in daily life.

519
00:45:09,004 --> 00:45:12,937
These manifest in sudden changes of mood,

520
00:45:13,006 --> 00:45:15,473
such as fits of rage

521
00:45:18,002 --> 00:45:22,003
and explosions of enthusiasm, which in greater or lesser measure

522
00:45:22,003 --> 00:45:27,006
permit us to experience the displacement of the ìIî towards the periphery

523
00:45:30,067 --> 00:45:37,800
at the same time that reversibility fails and the state becomes increasingly altered.

524
00:45:38,006 --> 00:45:41,239
We can observe the contrary, when in the face of sudden danger

525
00:45:43,633 --> 00:45:47,867
the subject contracts or flees,

526
00:45:48,004 --> 00:45:53,010
trying to put distance between themselves and the threatening object.

527
00:45:55,667 --> 00:46:00,833
In any case, the displacement of the ìIî is inward.

528
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:04,000
In this same vein we can confirm

529
00:46:04,006 --> 00:46:07,773
certain curious infantile behaviors.

530
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:14,567
In fact, children often use toy monsters

531
00:46:15,004 --> 00:46:20,471
to ìresistî or ìfight offî other monsters

532
00:46:21,867 --> 00:46:25,876
that are watching or drawing close in the night.

533
00:46:27,008 --> 00:46:30,475
And, when that technology does not work

534
00:46:32,167 --> 00:46:35,100
there always remains the recourse of hiding under the sheets;

535
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:41,007
hiding the body in the face of horrifying threats.

536
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:49,033
It is clear in these cases that the ìIî becomes absorbed and introjected.

537
00:46:51,133 --> 00:46:54,767
c. ìInspired consciousnessî.

538
00:47:02,733 --> 00:47:04,267
Ö Is everyone fine?

539
00:47:04,005 --> 00:47:05,008
Yes

540
00:47:20,967 --> 00:47:22,973
The inspired consciousness,

541
00:47:25,567 --> 00:47:29,569
the inspired consciousness is a global structure

542
00:47:30,004 --> 00:47:35,013
capable of achieving immediate intuitions of reality.

543
00:47:38,033 --> 00:47:39,167
On the other hand, it is well suited

544
00:47:41,267 --> 00:47:43,275
to organize ensembles of experience

545
00:47:44,067 --> 00:47:47,433
and to prioritize expressions which are usually transmitted

546
00:47:47,933 --> 00:47:52,700
through Philosophy, Science, Art and the Mystic.

547
00:47:56,133 --> 00:48:02,367
To assist with our development we could ask and answer, a bit like students:

548
00:48:03,433 --> 00:48:08,435
Is inspired consciousness a state of absorption or alteration?

549
00:48:09,833 --> 00:48:13,167
Is inspired consciousness a perturbed state,

550
00:48:13,767 --> 00:48:16,033
a rupture of normalcy,

551
00:48:16,533 --> 00:48:18,200
an extreme introjection,

552
00:48:18,467 --> 00:48:20,800
or an extreme projection?

553
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Doubtless inspired consciousness is more than a state,

554
00:48:26,003 --> 00:48:30,010
it is a global structure that passes through the different states

555
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,006
and that can manifest in different levels.

556
00:48:36,009 --> 00:48:38,842
Finally, it is more than an extreme introjection

557
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:42,668
or an extreme projection

558
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:49,004
since it makes use of either of these depending on its purpose.

559
00:48:50,667 --> 00:48:54,400
This last point is made evident when the inspired consciousness

560
00:48:54,667 --> 00:49:01,400
responds to an intention, to a present intention or,

561
00:49:01,004 --> 00:49:05,871
in some cases, when it responds to an intention that is not present

562
00:49:06,567 --> 00:49:09,000
but that acts copresently.

563
00:49:10,533 --> 00:49:15,533
In philosophy importance is given neither to inspiring dreams

564
00:49:17,233 --> 00:49:19,800
nor flashes of inspiration,

565
00:49:20,033 --> 00:49:24,500
but rather to direct intuition as applied by some thinkers

566
00:49:25,333 --> 00:49:29,338
in order to apprehend immediate realities of thought

567
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:35,767
without intermediation of deductive or discursive thought.

568
00:49:36,433 --> 00:49:39,967
This does not refer to ìintuitionistî currents

569
00:49:40,267 --> 00:49:42,200
in logic or mathematics

570
00:49:42,007 --> 00:49:46,140
but to thinkers who give priority to direct intuition

571
00:49:46,833 --> 00:49:49,840
as in the case of Platoís Ideas,

572
00:49:51,533 --> 00:49:54,967
of Descartesí clear and distinct ideas

573
00:49:54,967 --> 00:49:57,600
which leave aside the deceptions of the senses,

574
00:49:58,267 --> 00:50:01,273
and of Husserl with his descriptions of Noesis,

575
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:08,900
and ìsuspension of judgmentî making epochÈ, in parenthesis.

576
00:50:11,833 --> 00:50:16,842
Plato and Aristotle knew of the differences between intuitive and discursive thought;

577
00:50:19,867 --> 00:50:22,868
Plato giving priority to the former.

578
00:50:24,167 --> 00:50:30,233
For Plato the Ideas of the Good and the Beautiful are given by direct contemplation

579
00:50:31,003 --> 00:50:37,336
and are real, while good things and beautiful things derive from these Ideas

580
00:50:38,267 --> 00:50:42,200
and do not possess the same immediate reality.

581
00:50:43,001 --> 00:50:46,268
We recognize important contributions in Descartesí thought

582
00:50:46,008 --> 00:50:49,015
which thinks about itself without intermediation

583
00:50:50,008 --> 00:50:53,175
and in Husserlís direct contact with the noesis,

584
00:50:54,267 --> 00:50:57,100
the acts of thinking, and with the noemas,

585
00:50:57,367 --> 00:51:01,200
the objects linked intentionally with the acts of thinking.

586
00:51:04,008 --> 00:51:09,010
From the history of the science we can salvage examples of flashes of inspiration

587
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:12,272
that permitted important advances.

588
00:51:15,001 --> 00:51:18,568
The best-known case, though dubious,

589
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:20,800
though dubious,

590
00:51:22,133 --> 00:51:25,142
is that of Newtonís famous ìfalling appleî.

591
00:51:28,333 --> 00:51:30,336
If this indeed happened,

592
00:51:30,967 --> 00:51:34,972
we should recognize that the sudden inspiration was brought about

593
00:51:35,007 --> 00:51:38,240
by a slow but intense search

594
00:51:40,167 --> 00:51:45,133
oriented toward the cosmic system and the gravity of bodies.

595
00:51:46,007 --> 00:51:49,040
By way of examples, we could also keep in mind another case,

596
00:51:49,733 --> 00:51:51,742
that of the chemist KekulÈ

597
00:51:55,633 --> 00:52:01,367
who one night dreamt of several intertwined snakes

598
00:52:02,033 --> 00:52:07,200
which inspired him to develop notions in organic chemistry.

599
00:52:08,833 --> 00:52:13,841
Doubtless, it was his constant preoccupation with formulating the linkage among substances

600
00:52:14,867 --> 00:52:18,300
that continued to work even at the level of paradoxical sleep,

601
00:52:18,933 --> 00:52:22,938
taking the pathway of allegorical representation.

602
00:52:24,367 --> 00:52:28,300
This way he established the theory of the tetravalency of carbon

603
00:52:28,003 --> 00:52:31,270
and the hexagonal formula of benzeneÖ

604
00:52:36,067 --> 00:52:37,833
Very well.

605
00:52:40,133 --> 00:52:46,567
In Art there are many examples of inspiring dreams;

606
00:52:48,433 --> 00:52:50,500
as in the case of Mary Shelley

607
00:52:54,006 --> 00:52:56,739
who declared before friends,

608
00:53:02,008 --> 00:53:12,275
that she felt an ì...empty incapacity of invention that is the greatest misfortune for an authorî,

609
00:53:16,009 --> 00:53:17,676
but that night,

610
00:53:18,009 --> 00:53:20,011
but that night

611
00:53:21,667 --> 00:53:27,933
she saw in her dreams the horrible being that was to become the inspiration of her novel ìFrankenstein

612
00:53:28,733 --> 00:53:31,300
or the Modern Prometheusî.

613
00:53:32,533 --> 00:53:35,800
Something similar occurred with the dream of R. L. Stevenson,

614
00:53:36,333 --> 00:53:38,467
which set in motion his fantasy story

615
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:42,567
ìThe Strange Case of Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hydeî.

616
00:53:46,333 --> 00:53:50,000
Certainly in the field of the arts the vigilic inspiration of writers and poets

617
00:53:50,003 --> 00:53:54,836
are the best known cases.

618
00:53:56,002 --> 00:53:58,335
Nevertheless, we know of inspirations, in other media,

619
00:53:58,533 --> 00:54:02,100
such as, painters like Kandinsky,

620
00:54:03,767 --> 00:54:05,833
who in "Concerning the Spiritual in Art",

621
00:54:05,833 --> 00:54:11,500
described the inner need that expresses itself in artistic work as inspiration.

622
00:54:12,167 --> 00:54:17,169
Literary and plastic artists, musicians, dancers and actors

623
00:54:17,733 --> 00:54:21,700
have all tried to connect to non-habitual

624
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:25,900
mental and physical environments seeking inspiration.

625
00:54:28,467 --> 00:54:30,469
The various artistic styles

626
00:54:31,433 --> 00:54:33,800
which respond to epochal conditions

627
00:54:34,233 --> 00:54:42,367
are not simply fashions or ways to generate, capture, or interpret the artistic work,

628
00:54:42,767 --> 00:54:46,900
but rather ways of "preparing oneself"

629
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:51,875
to receive and to give sensory impactsÖ

630
00:54:53,003 --> 00:54:55,012
to place oneself, to take a disposition towards it.

631
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:03,633
This "disposition" modulates the individual or collective sensibility

632
00:55:04,033 --> 00:55:12,038
and is, therefore, the one pre-dialogical that permits us to establish aesthetic communication.

633
00:55:14,733 --> 00:55:19,400
In Mystic we find vast fields of inspiration.

634
00:55:20,133 --> 00:55:23,867
We must point out that when we speak of the ìmysticî in general

635
00:55:23,867 --> 00:55:28,200
we are considering the psychic phenomena of the "experience of the sacredî

636
00:55:29,004 --> 00:55:31,009
in its various depths and expressions.

637
00:55:32,002 --> 00:55:36,135
There exists a copious literature that speaks of the dreams,

638
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:39,600
visions in semisleep,

639
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,033
and the vigilic intuitions of those persons who are references

640
00:55:45,005 --> 00:55:48,009
for religions, sects and mystical groups.

641
00:55:50,267 --> 00:55:53,000
There are also numerous abnormal states

642
00:55:53,233 --> 00:55:57,467
and extraordinary cases of experiences of the sacred

643
00:55:57,933 --> 00:56:01,467
that can be classified as Ecstasy,

644
00:56:02,367 --> 00:56:07,200
that is, as mental situations in which the subjects remain absorbed,

645
00:56:07,533 --> 00:56:11,536
dazzled within themselves and suspended;

646
00:56:14,333 --> 00:56:16,339
on the other hand, the Rapture,

647
00:56:18,002 --> 00:56:23,835
uncontrollable motor and emotional agitation

648
00:56:24,667 --> 00:56:26,672
in which the subjects feel transported,

649
00:56:27,167 --> 00:56:31,169
carried out of themselves to other mental landscapes,

650
00:56:33,433 --> 00:56:36,300
to other times and spaces;

651
00:56:37,002 --> 00:56:39,569
and finally, as "Recognition"

652
00:56:39,767 --> 00:56:43,300
in which subjects believe that they comprehend everything in a single moment.

653
00:56:44,533 --> 00:56:47,540
In this point we are considering the inspired consciousness

654
00:56:48,233 --> 00:56:50,238
in its experience of the sacred

655
00:56:51,005 --> 00:56:54,538
which varies in the way it faces these extraordinary phenomena,

656
00:56:55,033 --> 00:57:00,400
and by extension those mental operations have been attributed

657
00:57:00,006 --> 00:57:03,014
even to the rapture of the poet or the musician,

658
00:57:05,167 --> 00:57:10,500
cases in which "the sacred" may not be present.

659
00:57:12,002 --> 00:57:14,969
We have mentioned the structures of consciousness

660
00:57:15,433 --> 00:57:18,200
that we call "inspired consciousness"

661
00:57:18,933 --> 00:57:20,942
and we have demonstrated their presence in the vast regions of

662
00:57:21,833 --> 00:57:24,167
philosophy, science, art and the mystic.

663
00:57:24,167 --> 00:57:28,168
But in the everyday life, in the everyday life

664
00:57:28,733 --> 00:57:35,739
inspired consciousness acts frequently in intuitions and inspirations

665
00:57:36,533 --> 00:57:40,537
of the vigil state, semisleep and paradoxical sleep.

666
00:57:41,367 --> 00:57:45,533
Examples of inspiration in daily life are such as the ìhunchesî,

667
00:57:47,567 --> 00:57:50,000
falling in love,

668
00:57:52,367 --> 00:57:56,133
the sudden comprehension of complex situations

669
00:57:56,867 --> 00:57:59,100
and the instantaneous resolution of problems

670
00:57:59,867 --> 00:58:03,800
that troubled the subject for a long time.

671
00:58:05,033 --> 00:58:08,040
These cases do not guarantee the correctness,

672
00:58:09,001 --> 00:58:13,834
the truth, or the coincidence of the phenomenon with respect to its object,

673
00:58:14,007 --> 00:58:17,540
but the registers of "certainty" that accompany them

674
00:58:18,467 --> 00:58:22,733
are of fundamental importance for the subject.

675
00:58:24,567 --> 00:58:30,333
Here we have left out many things,

676
00:58:32,005 --> 00:58:35,014
which are quite heavy so they will be read in a more appropriate momentÖ

677
00:58:36,006 --> 00:58:37,239
but not now...

678
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:44,268
for example the Upanishads say

679
00:58:44,007 --> 00:58:48,540
ìWhen the human spirit returned to repose,

680
00:58:50,533 --> 00:58:57,367
he retains with him the materials of the world in which is contained all things,

681
00:58:57,009 --> 00:59:01,342
and so creates and destroys its own glory and irradiation,

682
00:59:02,567 --> 00:59:05,700
so that the spirit glows with its own lightîÖ

683
00:59:05,009 --> 00:59:08,376
these guys are saying such beautiful thingsÖ

684
00:59:12,267 --> 00:59:18,500
In the Bible, Daniel explains that he ìalone saw the vision;

685
00:59:18,733 --> 00:59:21,400
the people who were with me did not see the vision,

686
00:59:22,002 --> 00:59:24,369
though a great trembling fell upon them,

687
00:59:24,767 --> 00:59:27,233
and they fled and hid themselves.î

688
00:59:27,005 --> 00:59:28,013
He saw it.

689
00:59:30,367 --> 00:59:35,368
In The Avesta. The Gathas. Yasna XLVI ,2-3.

690
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,267
The prophet says

691
00:59:40,006 --> 00:59:43,012
"I will proclaim this first teaching to the World.

692
00:59:45,667 --> 00:59:50,674
This teaching that the Omniscient Ahura Mazda revealed to meÖ

693
00:59:52,967 --> 00:59:56,333
The first teaching of the first universal religion,

694
00:59:56,006 --> 00:59:57,339
the first of the first,

695
00:59:57,933 --> 00:59:59,767
it's incredible,

696
01:00:00,367 --> 01:00:04,368
the man is sayingÖ heís revealing usÖ

697
01:00:06,967 --> 01:00:08,533
the first teaching.

698
01:00:10,833 --> 01:00:14,900
This teaching that the Omniscient Ahura Mazda revealed to me.

699
01:00:15,167 --> 01:00:19,500
I will speak of the two first Spirits of the world,

700
01:00:21,633 --> 01:00:26,641
of which the kind one said thus to the wicked one:

701
01:00:29,067 --> 01:00:31,300
There is nothing that our thoughts,

702
01:00:31,667 --> 01:00:33,433
our commandments,

703
01:00:33,733 --> 01:00:35,167
our intelligence,

704
01:00:35,004 --> 01:00:36,171
our beliefs,

705
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:38,100
our works,

706
01:00:38,004 --> 01:00:39,171
our consciousness,

707
01:00:39,008 --> 01:00:44,008
or our souls agree on".

708
01:00:47,733 --> 01:00:50,000
How fantastic!

709
01:00:50,004 --> 01:00:52,071
Thatís straight talkÖ

710
01:00:53,633 --> 01:00:55,367
nothing!

711
01:00:58,008 --> 01:01:03,017
And from here starts this dualism, this thing, they never had been able to findÖ

712
01:01:05,467 --> 01:01:07,470
Light and darkness, all this stuffÖ

713
01:01:08,233 --> 01:01:11,500
but how beautiful, how intelligent, how strange,

714
01:01:14,333 --> 01:01:16,337
of course, of courseÖ Well, okÖ

715
01:01:18,005 --> 01:01:26,572
d. Accidental phenomena and desired phenomena.

716
01:01:27,867 --> 01:01:33,600
Accidental phenomena, desired phenomena,

717
01:01:33,006 --> 01:01:36,273
things that one wants to happen.

718
01:01:39,006 --> 01:01:41,639
The consciousness can structure itself in different forms,

719
01:01:42,233 --> 01:01:45,900
varying through the action of specific stimuli (internal and external),

720
01:01:45,009 --> 01:01:49,776
or through the action of complex situations that work in an undesired way, an accidental way.

721
01:01:51,367 --> 01:01:53,333
The consciousness is "taken".

722
01:01:53,333 --> 01:01:55,367
The consciousness is "taken".

723
01:01:56,833 --> 01:01:58,067
Footnote:

724
01:01:58,067 --> 01:02:01,076
We understand ìtakenî as being neither directed or controlled by the subject.

725
01:02:02,333 --> 01:02:05,000
Fine, so the consciousness is "taken"

726
01:02:05,003 --> 01:02:08,670
in situations where reversibility and self-criticism

727
01:02:09,533 --> 01:02:12,100
are practically annulled.

728
01:02:13,933 --> 01:02:17,939
In the case that concerns us, "inspiration" bursts

729
01:02:20,004 --> 01:02:23,971
into mechanisms and levels, sometimes acting in a less obvious way

730
01:02:24,967 --> 01:02:28,033
as a ìbackgroundî of the consciousness.

731
01:02:28,533 --> 01:02:30,700
The subject is not inspired by a specific thing,

732
01:02:30,007 --> 01:02:35,874
rather it begins to be in the theme, to locate itselfÖ

733
01:02:37,006 --> 01:02:38,473
fineÖ

734
01:02:42,003 --> 01:02:49,012
On the other hand, also anguish, nausea, disgust and other configurations

735
01:02:50,004 --> 01:02:54,005
can appear suddenly, suddenly,

736
01:02:55,633 --> 01:03:01,167
or maintain themselves as more or less prolonged mental backgrounds.

737
01:03:01,967 --> 01:03:02,968
For example:

738
01:03:03,006 --> 01:03:06,039
when I accidentally turn over a rock

739
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:15,567
and discover a roiling mass of small insects that might swarm towards me

740
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:24,500
or sting my hand, I experience revulsion towards this formless life that assaults me.

741
01:03:26,133 --> 01:03:29,134
I also register a suppressed aversion

742
01:03:29,005 --> 01:03:36,072
when I perceive something sticky, damp and warm advancing towards me.

743
01:03:38,767 --> 01:03:43,833
varying through the action of specific stimuli (internal and external),

744
01:03:44,001 --> 01:03:46,068
response to danger,

745
01:03:47,733 --> 01:03:50,100
goes further than thatÖ goes beyond thatÖ

746
01:03:51,533 --> 01:03:54,467
since it commits me viscerally,

747
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,005
What does that mean? What does that mean? A visceral commitmentÖ

748
01:04:03,167 --> 01:04:07,833
causing a rejection that can end in the reflex of nausea,

749
01:04:08,067 --> 01:04:11,833
in retching or in excessive salivation,

750
01:04:13,006 --> 01:04:14,739
and it is not because I have eaten something,

751
01:04:19,004 --> 01:04:20,007
what is that?

752
01:04:27,001 --> 01:04:32,368
and in the extraordinary register that the distance has ìshortenedî,

753
01:04:32,967 --> 01:04:41,133
ìshortenedî distance between me and the object, or between myself and the disgusting situation.

754
01:04:43,067 --> 01:04:49,500
This shortening of space in the representation

755
01:04:50,433 --> 01:04:54,167
brings the object into a type of existence

756
01:04:54,433 --> 01:04:59,436
that allows it to ìtouch meî or to ìget inside of me,î

757
01:05:01,005 --> 01:05:05,338
provoking retching as a ritual of expulsion,

758
01:05:08,033 --> 01:05:09,167
as a ritual.

759
01:05:10,667 --> 01:05:11,900
The object is far from meÖ

760
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:16,600
but still it seems as it touches me, gets inside me and I who am far from it

761
01:05:17,933 --> 01:05:22,100
to defend myself from it, like the child with the monsters and all that,

762
01:05:22,008 --> 01:05:27,015
I end up retching, the other is there in his things,

763
01:05:29,005 --> 01:05:32,238
he mixes in my things and I vomit,

764
01:05:34,667 --> 01:05:36,670
get yourself togetherÖ

765
01:05:37,933 --> 01:05:39,967
what is all this magic,

766
01:05:40,007 --> 01:05:43,016
what are all these ritual actions, acts and objectsÖ

767
01:05:45,433 --> 01:05:47,900
itís tremendously shameful.

768
01:05:49,067 --> 01:05:53,076
A ritual of expulsion from inside my body, it's incredible,

769
01:05:54,267 --> 01:05:59,600
the ìclosenessî referred to is as irreal, as irreal

770
01:06:00,067 --> 01:06:03,067
as the corresponding reflex retchingÖ corresponding to that which is coming.

771
01:06:04,933 --> 01:06:09,940
Consequently, the relation between the disgusting object and the retching response

772
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:16,003
takes on its own characteristics which are outside of the real objects involved.

773
01:06:18,667 --> 01:06:25,669
They are converted into a ritual in which the object and the act form a particular structure,

774
01:06:26,167 --> 01:06:28,133
the structure of disgust.

775
01:06:31,167 --> 01:06:34,333
This accidental configuration of consciousness also occurs

776
01:06:34,567 --> 01:06:39,233
when facing a morally or aesthetically repugnant object,

777
01:06:40,367 --> 01:06:46,933
as in the case of a novel plagued by naivetÈ,

778
01:06:48,367 --> 01:06:50,400
plays on words

779
01:06:52,007 --> 01:06:58,474
and lukewarm, saccharine sentimentality, infused with a diffuse vitality.

780
01:07:02,867 --> 01:07:05,867
Itís a novel, thereís no reason for me to vomit.

781
01:07:08,733 --> 01:07:11,567
All of this ends up provoking in me a visceral defense

782
01:07:11,867 --> 01:07:15,633
that averts a profound ìinvasionî of my body.

783
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,008
These structures of consciousness compromise my unity,

784
01:07:21,003 --> 01:07:27,536
affecting not only ideas, emotions, and motor reactions,

785
01:07:28,003 --> 01:07:31,003
but my somatic totality.

786
01:07:31,008 --> 01:07:33,075
My physical totality.

787
01:07:35,002 --> 01:07:37,009
I believe that it would be opportune to make a small digression at this point.

788
01:07:39,009 --> 01:07:45,015
It is possible to consider advanced configurations of consciousness,

789
01:07:46,833 --> 01:07:48,000
advanced ones

790
01:07:48,233 --> 01:07:53,767
in which all types of violence provoke repugnance

791
01:07:55,233 --> 01:07:58,767
with the corresponding somatic correlates.

792
01:08:01,003 --> 01:08:04,670
The establishment in society

793
01:08:05,008 --> 01:08:08,009
of such a structuring of non-violent consciousness

794
01:08:10,533 --> 01:08:14,540
would be a profound cultural conquest.

795
01:08:17,003 --> 01:08:20,336
This would go beyond ideas or emotions

796
01:08:21,001 --> 01:08:24,010
which in present societies are only weakly manifested,

797
01:08:25,733 --> 01:08:33,767
to begin forming part of the psychosomatic and psychosocial framework of the human being.

798
01:08:34,867 --> 01:08:36,875
Ö just a digression, thatís allÖ

799
01:08:56,001 --> 01:08:58,034
Returning to our theme:

800
01:08:58,006 --> 01:09:02,873
We have recognized structures of consciousness that configure themselves accidentally.

801
01:09:05,002 --> 01:09:09,969
We also observe that there occur configurations that respond to desires,

802
01:09:10,733 --> 01:09:15,737
or to the plans of those who "putî themselves in a particular mental situation

803
01:09:16,567 --> 01:09:18,733
in order to cause the phenomenon to arise.

804
01:09:20,005 --> 01:09:23,772
Of course, such things function at times, and at other times they do not,

805
01:09:25,007 --> 01:09:28,011
as also happens with the desire for artistic inspiration

806
01:09:30,867 --> 01:09:33,733
or the desire to fall in love.

807
01:09:37,633 --> 01:09:43,267
The inspired consciousness, or better still, the consciousness prepared to achieve inspiration

808
01:09:43,533 --> 01:09:46,534
appears in philosophy, science, art,

809
01:09:46,633 --> 01:09:49,167
and also in everyday life, with various and suggestive examples.

810
01:09:49,167 --> 01:09:54,000
Nevertheless, it is especially in the mystic that the search for inspiration

811
01:09:54,002 --> 01:09:59,335
has given rise to practices, psychological practices and systems

812
01:09:59,933 --> 01:10:04,100
that have had, and continue to have, an unequalled level of development.

813
01:10:05,633 --> 01:10:09,267
We recognize the techniques of ìtranceî, trance,

814
01:10:10,006 --> 01:10:14,173
as belonging to the archeology of mystical inspirationÖ

815
01:10:16,167 --> 01:10:17,800
They exist.

816
01:10:20,433 --> 01:10:24,433
In official psychology trance is considered as;

817
01:10:24,433 --> 01:10:27,900
ìa state of dissociation of the consciousness

818
01:10:28,002 --> 01:10:31,335
characterized by the suspension of all voluntary movement

819
01:10:31,008 --> 01:10:33,775
and the existence of certain automatic activities.î

820
01:10:34,867 --> 01:10:39,800
Diccionario EnciclopÈdico de la Psique and so on, fine.

821
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,067
We recognize the techniques of ìtranceî

822
01:10:43,003 --> 01:10:45,010
as belonging to the archeology of mystical inspiration.

823
01:10:46,233 --> 01:10:52,400
So it is that we find trance in the most ancient forms of magic and religion.

824
01:10:53,467 --> 01:10:58,100
To provoke it, people have relied on the preparation of

825
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,667
more or less poisonous potions and the inhalation of fumes and vapors.

826
01:11:06,007 --> 01:11:10,174
Other techniques that are more elaborate in the sense of allowing the subject to control

827
01:11:11,067 --> 01:11:16,068
and progress in their mystical experience have been refined over a long period of time.

828
01:11:16,005 --> 01:11:20,012
Ritual dances, repetitive and exhausting ceremonies,

829
01:11:21,667 --> 01:11:26,733
fasts, prayers, exercises of concentration and meditation

830
01:11:27,001 --> 01:11:31,134
have all undergone considerable evolution in time.

831
01:11:32,967 --> 01:11:34,400
Here there is a footnoteÖ

832
01:11:34,633 --> 01:11:42,100
For example the Soma for the Indians and the Haoma for the Iranians,

833
01:11:42,008 --> 01:11:46,014
are the most ancient intoxicating drinks.

834
01:11:48,467 --> 01:11:52,200
In the Vedic Hymns 730 (2), we read:

835
01:11:53,000 --> 01:12:02,002
ìYou are the singer, you are the poet, you are the sweet juice born of the plant.

836
01:12:02,833 --> 01:12:06,838
In the intoxication you are the giver of all good.î

837
01:12:11,067 --> 01:12:11,074
Here it says:

838
01:12:11,833 --> 01:12:17,667
In Delphi the priestess of Apollo (pythia or pythoness)

839
01:12:19,233 --> 01:12:22,000
sat on a tripod

840
01:12:23,002 --> 01:12:29,469
located by a fissure in a rock from which rose an intoxicating vapor

841
01:12:30,002 --> 01:12:34,569
and she commenced to prophesize with incoherent words.

842
01:12:37,133 --> 01:12:40,967
In the preceding days

843
01:12:40,967 --> 01:12:48,600
the pythia had been immersed in fasting and chewing on Laurel leaves.

844
01:12:58,733 --> 01:13:01,300
Displacement of the ìIî. Suspension of the ìIî.

845
01:13:03,003 --> 01:13:04,936
The Sybil of Cumae,

846
01:13:08,167 --> 01:13:13,033
not wishing to be taken by the terrible inspiration,

847
01:13:14,433 --> 01:13:19,100
despairs and twists about shouting:

848
01:13:19,005 --> 01:13:22,138
ìAlready he comes, already the god comes!î.

849
01:13:24,133 --> 01:13:28,142
And, almost effortlessly the god Apollo descends from his sacred wood

850
01:13:29,003 --> 01:13:33,009
to the deep cave, where he possesses the prophetess.

851
01:13:37,167 --> 01:13:38,169
The footnote says:

852
01:13:38,367 --> 01:13:42,800
Virgilís fantastic description of the story of Cumae

853
01:13:43,033 --> 01:13:45,867
surely counts on more than enough information

854
01:13:46,005 --> 01:13:51,738
of the procedure used by the Sybils throughout Greek and Roman history.

855
01:13:52,833 --> 01:13:56,867
In any case, in Book Vl of the Aeneid the Sybil says:

856
01:13:57,367 --> 01:14:00,000
Ö we like it more how we put itÖ

857
01:14:00,008 --> 01:14:02,011
and in Virgil so speaks the Sybil:

858
01:14:04,767 --> 01:14:07,769
ìHe is here, the god is here!î

859
01:14:11,433 --> 01:14:14,167
Now heís coming, the god is comingÖ

860
01:14:16,333 --> 01:14:20,340
no, Virgil is explaining this in his styleÖ

861
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,633
well, heís RomanÖ

862
01:14:28,133 --> 01:14:30,667
ìHe is here, the god is here!

863
01:14:31,003 --> 01:14:33,012
And as she spoke these words at the entrance to the cave,

864
01:14:34,467 --> 01:14:39,800
Virgil says, ìher countenance changed and lost color.

865
01:14:40,033 --> 01:14:46,038
She tossed her hair; panting and breathless, her chest swollen,

866
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:52,633
full of sacred furor, she seemed taller, her voice does not resound

867
01:14:52,967 --> 01:14:55,800
like that of the other mortals

868
01:14:56,033 --> 01:15:01,038
as the godís presence drew nearer.î

869
01:15:14,667 --> 01:15:18,673
In this case as well as in other cultures, entrance into trance occurs through internalization of the ìIî

870
01:15:19,767 --> 01:15:21,300
and by an emotional exaltation,

871
01:15:21,967 --> 01:15:30,500
and by an emotional exaltation, so that those who practice these things note this well

872
01:15:30,867 --> 01:15:33,867
and by an emotional exaltationÖ

873
01:15:37,733 --> 01:15:39,167
and by an emotional exaltation

874
01:15:39,433 --> 01:15:45,067
in which is copresent the image of a god, of a force, or of a spirit

875
01:15:45,767 --> 01:15:48,773
that takes over and supplants the human personality.

876
01:15:51,567 --> 01:15:56,800
In cases of trance, the subject is placed at the disposition of an inspiration

877
01:15:57,067 --> 01:16:02,600
that permits them to grasp realities, and exercise powers unknown

878
01:16:03,533 --> 01:16:05,267
in everyday life.

879
01:16:06,033 --> 01:16:10,000
Nevertheless, we often read how the subject resists

880
01:16:11,033 --> 01:16:16,000
and even fights with the spirit, or god trying to resist the rapture

881
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,067
in convulsions that make one recall epilepsy,

882
01:16:21,005 --> 01:16:25,438
but that is part of a ritual that affirms the power of the entity

883
01:16:26,467 --> 01:16:29,033
that bends the normal will.

884
01:16:29,533 --> 01:16:30,534
Footnote:

885
01:16:31,467 --> 01:16:33,476
The ancients called epilepsy the ìsacred diseaseî.

886
01:16:36,004 --> 01:16:39,008
In the convulsions of this illness they believed they saw a struggle

887
01:16:40,033 --> 01:16:44,042
in which the subjects defended themselves from the alteration which was upon them.

888
01:16:45,733 --> 01:16:52,735
The gods announced their arrival through the ìauraî they sent in advance to the subject.

889
01:16:54,067 --> 01:16:59,033
They felt it coming, they felt it coming with the ìauraî.

890
01:17:00,867 --> 01:17:05,869
After the "attack", after the attack it was supposed

891
01:17:06,067 --> 01:17:09,033
that the subject remained inspired to prophesize.

892
01:17:09,367 --> 01:17:15,700
Not in vain is it claimed that Alexander, Caesar and even Napoleon

893
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:21,033
suffered from the "sacred disease" because, after all, they were men of combat.

894
01:17:21,004 --> 01:17:24,012
They were attacked and then they defended themselves in their wayÖ

895
01:17:25,007 --> 01:17:34,140
In Central America, the Haitian Voodoo cult

896
01:17:37,867 --> 01:17:39,533
allows us to understand techniques of trance

897
01:17:39,767 --> 01:17:45,033
realized through dances aided by the use of fish toxin based potions.

898
01:17:46,004 --> 01:17:49,537
In Brazil, the Macumba illustrate other variants in the mystic of trance

899
01:17:49,933 --> 01:17:55,267
attained through dance aided by use of an alcoholic beverage and tobacco.

900
01:17:55,767 --> 01:17:58,769
Not all cases of trance are as colorful as those mentioned.

901
01:17:59,833 --> 01:18:01,840
Some Indian techniques, those utilizing "yantras",

902
01:18:03,167 --> 01:18:09,300
allow one to arrive to trance through the interiorization of progressively smaller triangles

903
01:18:09,003 --> 01:18:14,005
in a complex geometric figure, which on occasion ends in a central point.

904
01:18:18,467 --> 01:18:20,933
Also in the technique of the "mantras"

905
01:18:21,567 --> 01:18:27,533
through the repetition of a profound sound the subject goes increasingly deeper

906
01:18:28,033 --> 01:18:30,900
until arriving at absorption.

907
01:18:33,001 --> 01:18:36,334
With these visual and auditory contemplations

908
01:18:37,333 --> 01:18:43,567
many Western practitioners do not have success

909
01:18:45,467 --> 01:18:49,200
because they are not prepared emotionallyÖ

910
01:18:50,167 --> 01:18:52,433
they press a button andÖ itís not like that,

911
01:18:52,867 --> 01:18:59,700
because they are not prepared emotionally and limit themselves to repeating those figures or sounds

912
01:19:00,007 --> 01:19:04,840
without internalizing them with the emotional or devotional force

913
01:19:05,009 --> 01:19:09,576
required for the cenesthetic representation

914
01:19:10,867 --> 01:19:14,400
to accompany the narrowing of the attention.

915
01:19:17,867 --> 01:19:21,900
These exercises are repeated as many times as necessary

916
01:19:22,767 --> 01:19:27,900
until the practitioners experience the replacement of their personalities

917
01:19:28,004 --> 01:19:30,871
and the inspiration is fully experienced.

918
01:19:34,367 --> 01:19:37,700
The displacement of the ìIî and its substitution by other entities

919
01:19:37,933 --> 01:19:39,938
can be verified in the cults mentioned earlier

920
01:19:41,003 --> 01:19:44,004
as well as in the most recent Spiritist currents.

921
01:19:46,133 --> 01:19:50,467
In these the ìmedium" in trance is taken by a spiritual entity

922
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,004
which becomes a substitute for their habitual personality.

923
01:19:55,008 --> 01:19:58,011
Something similar occurs in hypnotic trance

924
01:20:01,004 --> 01:20:05,137
when the subject deeply interiorizes the proposals,

925
01:20:06,033 --> 01:20:12,900
the suggestions of the operator raising the representation of the voice of the operator

926
01:20:13,002 --> 01:20:16,635
to the ìplaceî normally occupied by the habitual ìIî.

927
01:20:18,007 --> 01:20:21,008
I am telling you now, it is the voice of the operatorÖ

928
01:20:22,004 --> 01:20:25,007
I am giving you the orders, the ìIî is not giving the orders.

929
01:20:29,267 --> 01:20:31,274
Of course to be ìtakenî by the operator

930
01:20:32,167 --> 01:20:35,133
the subject must go into a receptive state of ìfaithî

931
01:20:35,333 --> 01:20:37,800
and follow the instructions received without harboring doubts.

932
01:20:38,433 --> 01:20:41,700
This point demonstrates an important characteristic of the consciousness.

933
01:20:42,067 --> 01:20:47,300
We are saying that while realizing a vigilic and attentive operation

934
01:20:47,667 --> 01:20:51,800
there appear reveries that are at times unnoticed,

935
01:20:52,333 --> 01:20:57,337
or which end up diverting the direction of the mental acts that are being carried out.

936
01:20:58,005 --> 01:21:00,008
The field of copresence is always acting

937
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,367
even though the objects present to consciousness

938
01:21:03,667 --> 01:21:06,433
take the attentional focus.

939
01:21:07,133 --> 01:21:10,900
The great quantity of automatic acts carried out in vigil

940
01:21:12,006 --> 01:21:15,008
demonstrates the capacity of the consciousness to carry out

941
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,133
different works simultaneously.

942
01:21:21,007 --> 01:21:25,140
Certainly, dissociation can reach a pathological degree

943
01:21:26,067 --> 01:21:28,433
but it can also manifest with force

944
01:21:28,667 --> 01:21:31,600
in almost all the phenomena of inspiration.

945
01:21:32,933 --> 01:21:35,367
On the other hand, the displacement of the ìIî

946
01:21:36,133 --> 01:21:39,141
cannot be complete in the spirit trance or hypnosis.

947
01:21:40,667 --> 01:21:43,933
This is verified in what is called ìautomatic writingî

948
01:21:44,567 --> 01:21:47,633
which is carried out without faltering even though the attention of the subject

949
01:21:47,633 --> 01:21:52,500
is focused in conversation or other activities.

950
01:21:52,833 --> 01:21:56,867
Frequently, we find this dissociation in ìcryptographyî

951
01:21:57,633 --> 01:21:59,639
in which the hand draws while the subject

952
01:22:00,467 --> 01:22:06,233
is deeply involved in a telephone conversation.

953
01:22:10,008 --> 01:22:14,941
Advancing towards absorption we could reach a point,

954
01:22:17,267 --> 01:22:20,700
in absorption we could reach a point

955
01:22:23,867 --> 01:22:29,133
in which the automatisms are left behind

956
01:22:30,733 --> 01:22:36,800
and where we are no longer dealing with a question of displacements or replacements of the ìIî.

957
01:22:39,001 --> 01:22:43,007
We have at hand the example given by the practice of the ìprayer of the heartî

958
01:22:44,067 --> 01:22:47,074
as carried out by the Orthodox monks of Mount Athos.

959
01:22:49,003 --> 01:22:54,004
The recommendations given by Evagrio Pontico turn out to be most adequate

960
01:22:54,004 --> 01:22:59,371
in order to avoid representations, at least those of the external senses:

961
01:23:00,002 --> 01:23:08,003
ìDo not imagine the divinity in you when you pray, do not imagine,

962
01:23:10,833 --> 01:23:16,867
nor let your intelligence accept the impression of any form whatever;

963
01:23:18,433 --> 01:23:22,436
maintain immaterial and you will understand.î

964
01:23:23,005 --> 01:23:25,838
WellÖ interesting.

965
01:23:27,867 --> 01:23:30,333
In broad strokes the prayer functions in this way:

966
01:23:32,002 --> 01:23:34,007
in the case of Mount Athos it works like this:

967
01:23:35,333 --> 01:23:40,700
the practitioner in silent retreat concentrates on their heart,

968
01:23:43,005 --> 01:23:49,772
takes a short phrase and gently draws the phrase,

969
01:23:50,533 --> 01:23:55,267
along with the air, down to the heart.

970
01:23:57,933 --> 01:23:59,938
One could not be saying thingsÖ eh, the air would not enter into the heartÖ

971
01:24:00,007 --> 01:24:03,040
donít speak like that, itís another thing, those are imagesÖ

972
01:24:05,004 --> 01:24:11,637
this is obvious, that weíre talking of another thing.

973
01:24:20,533 --> 01:24:23,700
So in broad strokes the prayer functions in this way:

974
01:24:27,003 --> 01:24:33,236
the practitioner in silent retreat concentrates on their heart,

975
01:24:34,067 --> 01:24:36,033
takes a short phrase,

976
01:24:36,567 --> 01:24:39,533
one has to take care that it is a short phrase,

977
01:24:40,567 --> 01:24:42,574
takes a short phrase and gently draws the phrase,

978
01:24:43,467 --> 01:24:47,800
along with the air, down to the heart,

979
01:24:53,067 --> 01:24:55,533
finishing the inhalation and,

980
01:24:55,009 --> 01:25:00,342
quotes, ìputting pressureî so they go deeper inward.

981
01:25:04,004 --> 01:25:08,005
Later, the air is exhaled very smoothly,

982
01:25:08,009 --> 01:25:11,009
without losing the attention in the heart.

983
01:25:12,833 --> 01:25:16,467
The monks repeated this practice many times a day

984
01:25:17,004 --> 01:25:20,371
until appeared some indicators of progress

985
01:25:21,933 --> 01:25:25,700
such as ìilluminationî, parenthesis, (of the space of representation).

986
01:25:29,009 --> 01:25:33,011
For the sake of precision we should acknowledge the passage through a state of trance

987
01:25:34,005 --> 01:25:38,538
in some moment of the repetitions of those prayers.

988
01:25:40,833 --> 01:25:43,667
The passage through trance is not very different

989
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:47,567
than that produced in the works with yantras or mantras,

990
01:25:48,006 --> 01:25:50,573
but in the practice of the ìprayer of the heartî

991
01:25:51,008 --> 01:25:53,575
the intent is not to be ìtakenî

992
01:25:54,009 --> 01:25:57,012
by entities that replace oneís own personality,

993
01:25:58,933 --> 01:26:05,300
rather the practitioner ends up surpassing the trance and ìsuspendingî the activity of their ìIî

994
01:26:08,008 --> 01:26:11,009
and suspending the activity of the ìIîÖ

995
01:26:14,233 --> 01:26:16,267
How can these guys do thatÖ

996
01:26:18,833 --> 01:26:21,834
In this sense, in the practices of Yoga

997
01:26:23,567 --> 01:26:27,700
one can also pass through different types and levels of trance,

998
01:26:29,133 --> 01:26:34,140
but we should keep in mind what Patanjali says in Sutra II of Book l:

999
01:26:35,267 --> 01:26:42,900
ìThe yoga aspires to the liberation from the disruptions of the mindî,

1000
01:26:43,167 --> 01:26:45,833
from the disruptions of the mind.

1001
01:26:47,001 --> 01:26:49,334
This system of practices goes in the direction

1002
01:26:49,633 --> 01:26:51,638
of the surpassing of the habitual ìIî,

1003
01:26:53,007 --> 01:26:56,014
the surpassing of the trances and the surpassing of the disassociations.

1004
01:26:59,533 --> 01:27:03,537
It is in advanced absorption outside of any trance and in full vigil,

1005
01:27:04,007 --> 01:27:09,574
that this ìsuspension of the ìIîî, of which we have sufficient indicators, is produced.

1006
01:27:11,267 --> 01:27:14,271
It is evident that from the beginning of their practice

1007
01:27:15,001 --> 01:27:19,834
the subject is oriented toward the disappearance of their "noises",

1008
01:27:21,967 --> 01:27:25,733
of their noises of consciousness dampening the external perceptions,

1009
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:30,001
representations, memories and expectations.

1010
01:27:31,009 --> 01:27:33,942
Some practices of yoga allow the mind to be quieted

1011
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:39,633
and to place the ìIî in state of suspension for a brief period.

1012
01:27:43,007 --> 01:27:47,013
The Aphorism of Yoga or Yoga Sutra compiled by Patanjali in the 2nd Century

1013
01:27:49,333 --> 01:27:53,334
is the first book of Yoga. It conserves unabridged

1014
01:27:53,008 --> 01:27:56,841
195 short and masterly sentences.

1015
01:28:01,002 --> 01:28:02,835
Well, at lastÖ

1016
01:28:03,004 --> 01:28:05,010
Access to the profound levels.

1017
01:28:07,367 --> 01:28:08,376
Is this understandable? More or less.

1018
01:28:19,003 --> 01:28:24,136
Doubtless the substitution of the ìIî by a force, a spirit,

1019
01:28:24,433 --> 01:28:28,700
a god, or the personality of a sorcerer or hypnotist,

1020
01:28:29,433 --> 01:28:31,767
is something present in history.

1021
01:28:34,004 --> 01:28:37,971
Also something known though not so much in the present,

1022
01:28:38,567 --> 01:28:41,569
is the suspending of the ìIî while avoiding any substitution,

1023
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,033
as we have seen in some types of yoga

1024
01:28:44,233 --> 01:28:46,667
and some advanced mystical practices.

1025
01:28:47,004 --> 01:28:51,011
So then, if someone could suspend

1026
01:28:53,002 --> 01:28:56,006
and then cause the ìIî to disappear,

1027
01:28:58,005 --> 01:29:03,738
they would lose all structural control of the temporality and spatiality of their mental processes.

1028
01:29:09,004 --> 01:29:13,071
They would be in a situation previous to that in which they learned

1029
01:29:14,167 --> 01:29:16,171
to take their first baby steps.

1030
01:29:17,667 --> 01:29:23,100
They would not be able to communicate to themselves nor coordinate the mechanisms of consciousness;

1031
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:30,567
they would not be able to appeal to memory; they would not be able to relate to the world

1032
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:35,006
and they would not be able to advance in their learning.

1033
01:29:36,233 --> 01:29:41,500
We would not be in the presence simply of an ìIî dissociated

1034
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:46,333
in some aspects, as occurs in certain mental conditions;

1035
01:29:46,767 --> 01:29:52,500
rather we would find ourselves with someone in a state that would seem like the state of vegetative sleep.

1036
01:29:55,233 --> 01:29:56,241
No images, no memoriesÖ,

1037
01:29:57,967 --> 01:30:01,967
if someone could achieve to make their ìIî disappear,

1038
01:30:05,002 --> 01:30:06,335
they would be a kind of a vegetable.

1039
01:30:12,001 --> 01:30:14,734
Give in to the disappearance of the "I"Ö

1040
01:30:16,009 --> 01:30:18,009
Don't talk like this, don't talk like this.

1041
01:30:20,967 --> 01:30:25,000
It does not walk on the street, it would get driven over by a car, no coordination.

1042
01:30:25,367 --> 01:30:33,200
Itís not like that, the ego, the egoÖ itís not like that.

1043
01:30:36,833 --> 01:30:42,836
This disappearance of the ìIî, let us make it clear, is not like that.

1044
01:30:44,533 --> 01:30:46,167
One does not know what one is speaking about.

1045
01:30:46,009 --> 01:30:48,014
One is talking of certain circumstances

1046
01:30:49,867 --> 01:30:53,876
where the ìIî could be suspended and of the ìIî,

1047
01:30:55,133 --> 01:30:58,136
of what happens in such a moment of suspension,

1048
01:30:58,933 --> 01:31:03,941
by bringing in a memory of interpreted representations

1049
01:31:05,233 --> 01:31:06,242
of what happens in such a momentÖ

1050
01:31:08,167 --> 01:31:09,000
well.

1051
01:31:15,067 --> 01:31:20,433
Nevertheless, it is possible to arrive at the mental situation of abolishing the ìIî,

1052
01:31:21,033 --> 01:31:22,367
not in everyday life,

1053
01:31:22,667 --> 01:31:26,668
not in everyday life, not in everyday lifeÖ

1054
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:33,533
but yes, in certain conditions that start off from the suspension of the ìIî.

1055
01:31:36,767 --> 01:31:42,300
Entrance to the profound states occurs from the suspension of the ìIî.

1056
01:31:44,008 --> 01:31:50,009
From that suspension, significant registers of "lucid consciousness"

1057
01:31:52,733 --> 01:31:56,500
and comprehension of oneís own mental limitations are produced,

1058
01:31:56,009 --> 01:31:58,018
which constitutes a great advance.

1059
01:32:01,001 --> 01:32:06,134
Regarding this transit one should keep in mind some inescapable conditions:

1060
01:32:06,006 --> 01:32:11,010
1. that the practitioner is clear about the Purpose that they want to achieve,

1061
01:32:13,167 --> 01:32:19,176
that the practitioner has the Purpose clear, the Purpose, that they want to achieveÖ

1062
01:32:24,967 --> 01:32:27,633
as the final objective of their work.

1063
01:32:28,267 --> 01:32:30,800
They are going in that direction, they know where theyíre going,

1064
01:32:31,067 --> 01:32:35,100
Do they know it? Do they know it? They don't study, they don't understand, it doesn't work...

1065
01:32:39,007 --> 01:32:44,740
first, that the practitioner is clear about the Purpose that they want to achieve

1066
01:32:45,008 --> 01:32:48,441
as the final objective of their work;

1067
01:32:49,667 --> 01:32:56,676
2. that they count on sufficient psychophysical energy

1068
01:32:58,633 --> 01:33:01,634
to maintain their attention absorbed

1069
01:33:02,267 --> 01:33:05,633
and concentrated on the suspension of the ìIî

1070
01:33:08,233 --> 01:33:14,400
and 3. that they can continue without interruption the continuous deepening

1071
01:33:14,006 --> 01:33:16,010
of the state of suspension until

1072
01:33:17,267 --> 01:33:19,700
the temporal and spatial references disappear.

1073
01:33:23,267 --> 01:33:28,267
With respect to the Purpose, it should be considered

1074
01:33:28,008 --> 01:33:33,015
as the direction of the whole process, even though it does not occupy the focus of the attention.

1075
01:33:36,003 --> 01:33:41,236
If this purpose is in this attentional focus, wanting to reach such a thing, well, there you lose it.

1076
01:33:43,967 --> 01:33:51,700
How do you do it then so that the purpose acts without producing the paradox

1077
01:33:52,367 --> 01:33:55,533
that you donít have to attend to it and if you attend to it, you block it,

1078
01:33:55,009 --> 01:33:57,342
so what do you do so that it would work.

1079
01:33:58,008 --> 01:34:01,975
You have to arrange so that you can put it in copresence.

1080
01:34:03,003 --> 01:34:10,870
Through the copresence, so that each step, with time, with regularity

1081
01:34:11,005 --> 01:34:15,005
and from such a placement from where these phenomena are managed

1082
01:34:15,867 --> 01:34:18,868
so that it is not necessary for the attention to be concentrated in the objects

1083
01:34:19,433 --> 01:34:22,800
because exactly it has to do with letting go of concentration in any object.

1084
01:34:25,007 --> 01:34:27,013
It seems like an extraordinary thing but it happens very often,

1085
01:34:28,633 --> 01:34:33,367
we know where we are going, we alone move the car with our body,

1086
01:34:33,009 --> 01:34:36,176
this way yes, that way no, without thinking about it,

1087
01:34:38,233 --> 01:34:40,237
because if we start thinking about it, we will crash.

1088
01:34:41,007 --> 01:34:45,440
We know where the route goes.

1089
01:34:47,933 --> 01:34:51,600
And when we are buttoning the buttons of the jacket,

1090
01:34:51,933 --> 01:34:54,300
weíre not thinking about them.

1091
01:34:54,933 --> 01:34:57,942
Itís an automatic act, copresence of habits which leads us

1092
01:34:59,967 --> 01:35:02,967
to know where the button 3 is and where the button 4 is.

1093
01:35:05,133 --> 01:35:09,000
Thousands of data working from the copresence.

1094
01:35:09,467 --> 01:35:11,333
Sure, we are talking of serious matters

1095
01:35:11,008 --> 01:35:13,012
and it is good to recall that this work is also

1096
01:35:14,006 --> 01:35:15,015
in the more basic things.

1097
01:35:18,001 --> 01:35:22,006
Work with the copresences which guide, give directions

1098
01:35:22,933 --> 01:35:29,500
to the human being, guiding the human being from those profound purposes.

1099
01:35:35,003 --> 01:35:39,036
With respect to the Purpose, it should be considered

1100
01:35:40,033 --> 01:35:43,667
as the direction of the whole process, even though it does not occupy the attentional focus.

1101
01:35:44,533 --> 01:35:47,537
We are saying that the Purpose must be "recorded"

1102
01:35:48,667 --> 01:35:51,672
with sufficient emotional charge

1103
01:35:52,433 --> 01:35:54,367
so that it is able to operate copresently

1104
01:35:54,633 --> 01:35:57,800
while the attention is busy with the suspension of the ìIî

1105
01:35:58,233 --> 01:35:59,500
and in the subsequent steps.

1106
01:35:59,008 --> 01:36:02,012
This preparation conditions all of the subsequent work.

1107
01:36:05,005 --> 01:36:07,006
As for the psychophysical energy necessary

1108
01:36:07,006 --> 01:36:11,007
for maintaining the attention in an interesting level of concentration,

1109
01:36:12,001 --> 01:36:18,434
the main impulse stems from the interest that forms part of the Purpose.

1110
01:36:19,006 --> 01:36:20,039
One has to raise energyÖ

1111
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,967
Neither taking away nor adding...

1112
01:36:24,833 --> 01:36:30,835
If one is interested in thatÖ this works.

1113
01:36:37,733 --> 01:36:41,735
On verifying a lack of potency and permanence,

1114
01:36:42,006 --> 01:36:46,939
one should review the preparation of the Purpose.

1115
01:36:49,333 --> 01:36:52,200
What is required is a consciousness cleared of fatigue

1116
01:36:53,033 --> 01:36:57,400
and with a certain minimal education in the reduction of the attentional focus onto a single object.

1117
01:37:00,133 --> 01:37:04,767
Continuing with the deepening of the suspension until achieving the register of "emptiness"

1118
01:37:06,467 --> 01:37:10,700
signifies that nothing should appear as a representation,

1119
01:37:12,133 --> 01:37:14,467
or as a register of internal sensations.

1120
01:37:16,033 --> 01:37:20,400
There should not, and cannot be a register of this mental situation.

1121
01:37:21,167 --> 01:37:27,100
And the return from the mental situation of suspension to habitual vigil

1122
01:37:27,008 --> 01:37:31,010
is produced by impulses that reveal the position

1123
01:37:32,003 --> 01:37:33,670
and the discomforts of the body.

1124
01:37:34,167 --> 01:37:35,700
The person returns.

1125
01:37:38,767 --> 01:37:40,772
Nothing can be said about this ìvoidî.

1126
01:37:44,533 --> 01:37:47,067
Nothing can be said about this ìvoidî.

1127
01:37:48,267 --> 01:37:51,269
The recovery of inspiring meanings,

1128
01:37:53,433 --> 01:37:55,567
of the deep meanings

1129
01:37:57,167 --> 01:38:01,400
that are beyond the mechanisms and the configurations of consciousness,

1130
01:38:02,007 --> 01:38:10,274
are carried out by my ìIî when it returns to its normal vigilic work.

1131
01:38:12,001 --> 01:38:16,001
We are speaking of ìtranslationsî of deep impulses,

1132
01:38:16,867 --> 01:38:20,200
which arrive to my intrabody during deep sleep,

1133
01:38:20,006 --> 01:38:24,039
or of impulses that arrive to my consciousness in a type of perception that is different

1134
01:38:25,233 --> 01:38:28,600
from the perceptions we know at the moment when we ìreturnî to the normal vigil.

1135
01:38:29,967 --> 01:38:31,833
We cannot speak of that world

1136
01:38:32,001 --> 01:38:35,868
because we do not have registers during the absence of the ìIî;

1137
01:38:37,633 --> 01:38:42,200
we have only ìreminiscencesî of that world,

1138
01:38:43,033 --> 01:38:46,040
as Plato mentioned in his myths.

1139
01:38:48,008 --> 01:38:49,016
Thatís all.
