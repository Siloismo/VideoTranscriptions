Humanism and the Crisis of Civilization

00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:10,009
Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia.

3
00:00:11,533 --> 00:00:16,167
June 18, 1992.

4
00:00:33,006 --> 00:00:36,773
I wish to thank the Club for Humanist Initiatives,

5
00:00:39,433 --> 00:00:44,000
the representatives from the various fields of culture who are present today,

6
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:48,012
as well as the translators

7
00:00:51,567 --> 00:00:54,600
and publishers of my works,

8
00:00:56,133 --> 00:01:03,137
and the many friends who have invited me to speak today.

9
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:07,541
I thank the media who are here and, of course,

10
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:12,341
I thank all of you for your presence.

11
00:01:17,933 --> 00:01:26,300
You will, I am sure, forgive some of the difficulties related to the fact that my remarks must be interpreted into Russian,

12
00:01:26,006 --> 00:01:34,239
and thus appreciate the fact that I am obliged to limit the length of my talk because of the time that requires.

13
00:01:35,033 --> 00:01:41,042
Given these circumstances, more than one idea will have to be compressed.

14
00:01:45,267 --> 00:01:52,233
Our subject, “Humanism and the Crisis of Civilization,” requires us, as a first step

15
00:01:53,433 --> 00:02:03,200
and before developing today’s theme, to examine the concept of “civilization.”

16
00:02:04,733 --> 00:02:11,267
Much has been written and much debated about the word “civilization.”

17
00:02:12,004 --> 00:02:14,971
In the early period of the Philosophy of History,

18
00:02:15,967 --> 00:02:22,969
an understanding developed regarding the various civilizations

19
00:02:23,006 --> 00:02:26,873
as historical entities,

20
00:02:27,667 --> 00:02:33,668
each with its own process, its own evolution, its own destiny.

21
00:02:37,233 --> 00:02:43,000
This entity, a civilization, was taken to be an ambit,

22
00:02:43,233 --> 00:02:48,000
a region of human behaviors

23
00:02:48,967 --> 00:02:58,971
that would allow us to identify nations or peoples with a certain mode of production,

24
00:03:00,001 --> 00:03:11,068
certain social relationships, a specific legal system, and a characteristic scale of values.

25
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:21,967
In general, the idea of “a people” or “a nation” was not equated with that of “civilization”;

26
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:27,900
instead, a number of peoples or nations,

27
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:36,042
spanning borders and territories, could be grouped together within a common ambit.

28
00:03:38,733 --> 00:03:42,000
Traditionally, civilizations have been associated

29
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,967
with what could be called “cultural spaces” that were generally rooted within certain geographical boundaries

30
00:03:51,133 --> 00:03:56,139
and viewed as having the ability both to radiate outward and to receive influences

31
00:03:56,967 --> 00:04:00,970
from other, more or less contiguous ones.

32
00:04:02,007 --> 00:04:10,640
When we speak of the Egyptian civilization or the Greek civilization, for example,

33
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:17,200
we are referring to those sorts of ambits of human behavior,

34
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:30,267
and in no way are we implying that some more or less centralizing artifice

35
00:04:31,005 --> 00:04:39,538
such as a State is the decisive factor in the articulation of those ambits.

36
00:04:41,002 --> 00:04:46,006
The fact that the Macedonians or the Spartans played a role in Hellenic culture,

37
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:57,171
without thereby being part of a league of city-states, and indeed the fact that they fought among themselves,

38
00:04:57,009 --> 00:05:04,976
shows that the State is not the essential factor in the definition of a civilization.

39
00:05:06,008 --> 00:05:11,241
And so it is that rootedness in a certain geographical space has traditionally allowed us to speak

40
00:05:12,003 --> 00:05:18,004
of the “Mesopotamian civilization” or “the civilization of the Nile”

41
00:05:18,007 --> 00:05:22,640
or “island civilizations,” and so on.

42
00:05:24,967 --> 00:05:31,800
Implicit in this type of classification, of course, is a conception

43
00:05:31,008 --> 00:05:39,014
of the nature of civilization in which every civilization is determined by geographical circumstances

44
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:44,011
—just as when we speak of the civilizations

45
00:05:45,001 --> 00:05:53,268
of “the vine,” or of “milk and honey,” or the civilizations of “maize,”

46
00:05:53,367 --> 00:05:58,370
we are referring to them in terms of their food resources,

47
00:05:58,667 --> 00:06:03,833
and when we speak of “Neolithic” civilizations

48
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:11,840
we are denoting the cultural stage of the civilization by its tool production and technology.

49
00:06:13,933 --> 00:06:18,767
More important than this effort at classification, however,

50
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:26,005
has been the work done since the time of Vico

51
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:31,967
in attempting to understand and define the temporal stages of civilizations,

52
00:06:31,967 --> 00:06:39,200
the evolution and future of a given civilization as well as its destiny.

53
00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:46,142
From that corsi e ricorsi of human events

54
00:06:47,567 --> 00:06:53,033
that Vico, the genial Neapolitan, attempted to understand

55
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:59,867
(on the basis of a general idea of historical development,

56
00:07:00,067 --> 00:07:05,076
a set of axioms, and a philological method),

57
00:07:06,567 --> 00:07:09,933
to the historiology of Toynbee

58
00:07:10,233 --> 00:07:13,800
(based on the concept of challenge and response,

59
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:19,400
in turn anticipated by Pavlov’s physiological studies),

60
00:07:20,267 --> 00:07:24,333
a great deal of ink has been spent in trying to make a science

61
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:28,500
out of these more or less confused ideas.

62
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:35,342
Naturally, these efforts have been rewarded with greater and lesser degrees of success.

63
00:07:36,007 --> 00:07:42,040
Comte’s “law” was that civilization passed

64
00:07:43,002 --> 00:07:46,435
from a heroic and theological age

65
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,700
through a metaphysical stage to, at last,

66
00:07:49,933 --> 00:07:53,933
a positive moment of rationality,

67
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:58,900
abundance, and justice.

68
00:07:59,467 --> 00:08:03,233
Hegel spoke of civilizations as manifestations

69
00:08:03,867 --> 00:08:09,876
of the dialectical stages of the development of the Absolute Spirit,

70
00:08:11,433 --> 00:08:19,167
and Spengler presented civilizations as biographical protoforms,

71
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:22,500
entities that proceed biologically

72
00:08:22,733 --> 00:08:29,700
through the stages of birth, youth, maturity, and death.

73
00:08:31,001 --> 00:08:32,568
Great effort has been expended

74
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:37,675
in attempting to understand the functioning and the destiny of civilizations,

75
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:43,933
but many of the researchers and philosophers who have undertaken those efforts

76
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:47,267
have not gone deep enough into the basic and primary fact,

77
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:55,575
the recognition that their questions and their answers

78
00:08:56,006 --> 00:09:00,139
all arise out of their own cultural landscapes,

79
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:05,934
the particular historical moments in which they live.

80
00:09:06,267 --> 00:09:14,300
And if today we want to find a new response to this theme of “civilization,”

81
00:09:14,767 --> 00:09:20,333
we cannot avoid the difficulty (or aid)

82
00:09:20,567 --> 00:09:25,570
of the cultural landscape in which we were formed and educated,

83
00:09:26,001 --> 00:09:30,834
or the historical moment in which we now happen to live.

84
00:09:31,467 --> 00:09:34,476
Today, if we truly want to understand

85
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:38,369
the flux of civilizations, we must first ask ourselves

86
00:09:39,267 --> 00:09:44,533
about the conditions of our own lives, and in this way

87
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:49,733
we will be humanizing the historical process

88
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:53,033
upon which we are reflecting.

89
00:09:54,433 --> 00:09:57,100
We do this not by interpreting the events

90
00:09:57,001 --> 00:10:01,004
produced by the human being from the outside,

91
00:10:01,004 --> 00:10:04,837
as is typically done in a history book,

92
00:10:05,233 --> 00:10:10,300
but rather by understanding, on the basis of historical structure,

93
00:10:10,003 --> 00:10:13,136
that which gives meaning to human life,

94
00:10:13,433 --> 00:10:17,441
that which takes place in the situation we are living in.

95
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:23,967
This focus will lead us to see the limitations that we face

96
00:10:23,967 --> 00:10:30,933
in formulating certain questions and in giving certain answers,

97
00:10:31,133 --> 00:10:35,967
because the very moment in which we live

98
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:45,369
makes it difficult for us to break out of our own beliefs and cultural assumptions

99
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:50,942
—and it is only by breaking out of our beliefs,

100
00:10:52,067 --> 00:10:58,075
only through the appearance of events that we believed to be impossible,

101
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:06,200
that we will be able to advance toward a new moment of civilization.

102
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:07,440
As you know,

103
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,009
we are talking about the vital situation of crisis

104
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:17,776
in which we are immersed today and, consequently,

105
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:23,642
about a moment of rupture in the beliefs and cultural assumptions

106
00:11:24,533 --> 00:11:27,537
that formed us.

107
00:11:29,933 --> 00:11:33,938
To characterize the crisis from that point of view,

108
00:11:34,433 --> 00:11:43,067
we might attend to four phenomena that directly impact us:

109
00:11:43,067 --> 00:11:53,533
1. Driven by the technological revolution, the world is changing rapidly,

110
00:11:53,767 --> 00:11:58,000
causing changes that clash with the established structures

111
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,007
and habits of life of both societies and individuals;

112
00:12:05,067 --> 00:12:13,069
2. The mismatch between the speed of technological acceleration

113
00:12:13,005 --> 00:12:16,012
and the relative slowness of social adaptation to change

114
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:23,469
is generating progressive crises in every field,

115
00:12:23,867 --> 00:12:27,867
and there is no reason to suppose that this process will stop

116
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:33,002
—indeed, quite the contrary, it will tend to increase;

117
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:38,538
3. The unexpectedness of events

118
00:12:39,007 --> 00:12:45,140
prevents us from foreseeing what direction those events,

119
00:12:46,001 --> 00:12:52,008
the people around us, and in particular our own lives will take.

120
00:12:53,133 --> 00:12:57,567
It is not, however, change itself that concerns us

121
00:12:57,567 --> 00:13:03,200
so much as the increasing unpredictability of that change;

122
00:13:04,267 --> 00:13:13,271
and 4. Many of the things we once thought and believed are no longer useful.

123
00:13:15,033 --> 00:13:21,967
But neither are there solutions in sight from society, institutions, or individuals

124
00:13:22,233 --> 00:13:29,867
—all of whom are suffering these same difficulties.

125
00:13:31,267 --> 00:13:35,233
And while we need references,

126
00:13:35,005 --> 00:13:44,138
our traditional references are proving to be obsolete and asphyxiating.

127
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:58,267
In my view, it is in this region of the world more than any other

128
00:13:58,007 --> 00:14:03,274
that the greatest acceleration of conditions

129
00:14:04,433 --> 00:14:08,300
for historical change is taking place

130
00:14:09,267 --> 00:14:13,270
—a confusing and painful acceleration

131
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:19,476
out of which a new moment in civilization is being born.

132
00:14:21,009 --> 00:14:26,942
Here, no one knows today what’s going to happen tomorrow,

133
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:37,004
but in other parts of the world people naively assume

134
00:14:38,006 --> 00:14:44,773
that civilization will continue in a predictable direction

135
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,533
within a long-established economic and social model.

136
00:14:54,533 --> 00:14:57,867
Of course, that way of looking at things

137
00:14:58,433 --> 00:15:02,200
is more a matter of mood,

138
00:15:02,005 --> 00:15:09,672
something closer to wishful thinking, than it is a position justified by the facts,

139
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:15,141
because as soon as one examines what is happening

140
00:15:15,933 --> 00:15:20,600
one arrives at the conclusion that the world

141
00:15:20,006 --> 00:15:32,073
—the world as a whole, not schizophrenically divided between East and West—

142
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:39,333
is moving toward increasing instability.

143
00:15:42,003 --> 00:15:48,070
To look exclusively at one type of State,

144
00:15:48,008 --> 00:15:53,841
one type of administration, or one type of economy

145
00:15:54,967 --> 00:15:58,968
in interpreting the flow of events

146
00:15:59,003 --> 00:16:02,336
demonstrates an intellectual limitation and a shortsightedness

147
00:16:02,633 --> 00:16:10,500
that expose the foundation of beliefs we have incorporated during our cultural formation.

148
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:17,636
Moreover, we can see that the social and historical landscape in which we are living

149
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:26,940
has changed drastically from the one in which we lived only a few years ago

150
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:36,033
but that the instruments of analysis we are using

151
00:16:36,033 --> 00:16:43,167
to interpret these new situations still belong to that old landscape.

152
00:16:44,633 --> 00:16:47,267
Yet the difficulties are even greater,

153
00:16:48,033 --> 00:16:53,967
because we also have a sensibility that was formed in an earlier time,

154
00:16:54,002 --> 00:17:00,002
and the evolution of this sensibility has not kept pace with events.

155
00:17:00,967 --> 00:17:08,100
It is surely for this reason that all over the world

156
00:17:08,467 --> 00:17:13,600
we see a growing separation,

157
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:22,600
between those who hold economic, political, and artistic power

158
00:17:24,133 --> 00:17:31,500
and the new generations who feel very differently

159
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:40,000
about the function that institutions and leaders ought to serve in these new times.

160
00:17:41,004 --> 00:17:44,837
I believe that now is the moment to say something

161
00:17:45,433 --> 00:17:51,000
that will probably strike the old sensibility as scandalous, and it is this:

162
00:17:51,002 --> 00:18:02,009
The economic or social model that is discussed day after day by the opinion-makers

163
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:11,867
is not the central interest for the new generations;

164
00:18:12,003 --> 00:18:18,936
rather, they wish that institutions and leaders

165
00:18:19,567 --> 00:18:27,569
were not just one more encumbrance on this already complicated world.

166
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:31,737
They are looking for a new alternative,

167
00:18:32,133 --> 00:18:36,000
because to them today’s models seem worn out.

168
00:18:36,233 --> 00:18:43,233
Yet, at the same time, they are unwilling to follow ideas or leadership

169
00:18:43,633 --> 00:18:46,638
that do not coincide with their new sensibility.

170
00:18:48,009 --> 00:18:55,876
Many people consider this irresponsible on the part of the young,

171
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
but I am not talking about responsibility

172
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:12,467
—I am talking about a type of sensibility that must be taken seriously into account.

173
00:19:15,267 --> 00:19:21,268
And this is not a problem that can be solved with opinion polls

174
00:19:21,367 --> 00:19:29,372
or surveys to find a new way of manipulating society;

175
00:19:30,233 --> 00:19:36,236
it is a problem involving an overall appreciation of the meaning of the concrete human being,

176
00:19:36,767 --> 00:19:43,774
who until today has been appealed to in theory and betrayed in practice.

177
00:19:46,367 --> 00:19:52,333
If someone would object to these comments by replying that

178
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:59,336
in this crisis the peoples of the world want concrete solutions,

179
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:08,675
I would say that it is one thing to promise concrete solutions

180
00:20:09,733 --> 00:20:16,767
and something quite different to achieve concrete solutions in practice.

181
00:20:17,933 --> 00:20:23,867
What is concrete is that people no longer believe in promises,

182
00:20:24,467 --> 00:20:28,474
and that is much more important as a psychosocial reality

183
00:20:29,667 --> 00:20:33,333
than more promises of solutions

184
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:37,767
that people intuitively sense will never be kept in practice.

185
00:20:37,767 --> 00:20:43,100
The crisis of credibility is also dangerous,

186
00:20:44,003 --> 00:20:49,336
because it throws us defenseless into the hands of demagoguery

187
00:20:49,867 --> 00:20:55,600
and the charisma of any leader promising instant solutions

188
00:20:55,006 --> 00:20:58,673
and able to play upon people’s deepest emotions.

189
00:20:59,267 --> 00:21:03,269
But all of this, though I’ve often pointed it out,

190
00:21:03,007 --> 00:21:09,640
can be difficult to take in, because of the impediment

191
00:21:10,008 --> 00:21:14,041
posed by our landscape of formation,

192
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:19,700
in which we still confuse actions

193
00:21:19,967 --> 00:21:23,976
with the words used to speak of these actions.

194
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:29,838
We have reached a point at which it is clear

195
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:33,669
that we need to ask ourselves once and for all

196
00:21:34,733 --> 00:21:37,867
whether or not the look that we have been using in order to understand these problems

197
00:21:37,867 --> 00:21:39,875
is adequate to the task.

198
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:44,667
What I’m saying is not really so strange,

199
00:21:44,933 --> 00:21:48,941
since scientists in various disciplines

200
00:21:50,033 --> 00:21:55,300
have long since stopped believing that they were observing reality itself

201
00:21:55,633 --> 00:22:00,000
and have become concerned with understanding how their act of observation

202
00:22:00,002 --> 00:22:04,005
interferes with the phenomenon they are studying.

203
00:22:05,001 --> 00:22:08,002
As we would put it,

204
00:22:08,002 --> 00:22:15,535
this means that observers introduce elements from their own landscapes

205
00:22:15,733 --> 00:22:19,700
that do not exist in the phenomenon being studied,

206
00:22:20,067 --> 00:22:25,333
and that the look we direct at the field of study

207
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:29,700
focuses on a limited region within that ambit,

208
00:22:29,007 --> 00:22:36,174
so that we come to pay attention to questions that are not really of central importance.

209
00:22:37,733 --> 00:22:40,734
All of this becomes much more serious

210
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:46,600
when people attempt to justify political positions by saying

211
00:22:46,006 --> 00:22:51,139
that everything they do is carried out with the human being in mind,

212
00:22:52,005 --> 00:22:55,872
when in fact that is not what they have in mind at all

213
00:22:56,007 --> 00:23:02,740
but rather other factors that end up displacing human beings

214
00:23:04,033 --> 00:23:08,500
to a secondary position.

215
00:23:09,167 --> 00:23:13,169
Similarly, in no way is it recognized that it is only through understanding

216
00:23:13,367 --> 00:23:16,733
the structure of human life

217
00:23:17,001 --> 00:23:22,834
that we can reach a full comprehension of the realities and the destiny of civilization.

218
00:23:22,933 --> 00:23:26,500
This leads us to realize that the theme of human life

219
00:23:26,007 --> 00:23:31,009
is much talked about but not truly taken into account,

220
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:37,142
because it is believed that the life of human beings is not the agent and producer of events

221
00:23:38,233 --> 00:23:47,400
but instead only the recipient of macro-economic, ethnic, religious, or geographical forces;

222
00:23:47,733 --> 00:23:53,000
because the assumption is that what must be demanded of people is,

223
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:00,007
objectively, labor and social discipline and, subjectively, credulity and obedience.

224
00:24:01,967 --> 00:24:02,974
Having made these observations

225
00:24:03,667 --> 00:24:06,675
about how we might consider the phenomena of civilization—

226
00:24:08,167 --> 00:24:11,700
while taking into account our landscape of education and formation,

227
00:24:11,967 --> 00:24:14,200
our beliefs, and our values—

228
00:24:14,002 --> 00:24:19,006
let’s now to turn our attention to the central subject of this talk.

229
00:24:21,033 --> 00:24:26,167
Our present situation of crisis does not involve separate civilizations,

230
00:24:26,005 --> 00:24:29,872
as was the case in earlier times when those entities could interact,

231
00:24:30,367 --> 00:24:36,933
while ignoring or adopting elements from one another.

232
00:24:37,633 --> 00:24:41,638
In the process of increasing planetarization that we are experiencing today,

233
00:24:42,005 --> 00:24:51,938
we must interpret events as occurring in a dynamic that is both structural and global.

234
00:24:53,367 --> 00:25:01,700
Yet everything we see is being destructured,

235
00:25:03,233 --> 00:25:05,240
The nation state is reeling

236
00:25:05,933 --> 00:25:10,067
from the blows it receives from below—separatism and parochialism—

237
00:25:10,005 --> 00:25:14,014
and from above—regionalization and planetarization;

238
00:25:15,967 --> 00:25:24,000
individuals, cultural codes, languages, and goods

239
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,007
are all mixed up together in a fantastic tower of Babel;

240
00:25:29,267 --> 00:25:34,033
centralized corporations are suffering the crisis of having to become more flexible

241
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:37,800
in ways that they can’t manage to implement;

242
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:41,800
an ever-widening gap is opening between the generations,

243
00:25:42,067 --> 00:25:48,833
as though in the same moment there exist subcultures separated from one another

244
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:51,767
not only by their pasts but also by their future projects;

245
00:25:52,267 --> 00:25:56,274
family members, coworkers, political, labor, and social organizations

246
00:25:57,003 --> 00:26:01,670
are all experiencing the action

247
00:26:01,967 --> 00:26:06,033
of disintegrative centrifugal forces;

248
00:26:06,033 --> 00:26:10,267
ideologies, tossed about in this whirlwind,

249
00:26:10,267 --> 00:26:16,267
are no longer able to offer answers or inspire coherent action in human groups;

250
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:22,873
traditional solidarity is disappearing from a social fabric that is continuing to unravel;

251
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,133
and finally, individuals,

252
00:26:27,004 --> 00:26:31,971
while today they have—especially with the mass media

253
00:26:32,767 --> 00:26:36,033
—ever greater numbers of people in their daily landscapes,

254
00:26:36,033 --> 00:26:41,037
at the same time feel increasingly isolated and cut off from others.

255
00:26:43,933 --> 00:26:52,367
All of this demonstrates that even these destructuring and paradoxical events

256
00:26:52,567 --> 00:26:59,572
respond to the same process, which is worldwide and structural.

257
00:27:00,006 --> 00:27:04,439
And if the old ideologies cannot give answers to these phenomena,

258
00:27:05,033 --> 00:27:10,038
it is because they, too, are part of the world that is vanishing.

259
00:27:11,008 --> 00:27:17,009
No doubt there are many people who think that these events mark the end of ideas

260
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:19,015
and the end of History,

261
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:24,072
of conflict, and of human progress.

262
00:27:25,006 --> 00:27:28,173
For our part, this is indeed what we call “crisis,”

263
00:27:28,767 --> 00:27:34,771
but we are very far from viewing this crisis as some final decline,

264
00:27:35,567 --> 00:27:40,574
because we see that in reality the dissolution of the previous forms

265
00:27:41,467 --> 00:27:48,472
is like outgrowing clothing that has now become too small for the human being.

266
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:52,008
These events, which have begun to occur

267
00:27:52,008 --> 00:27:55,014
with greater acceleration in some places sooner than in others,

268
00:27:56,767 --> 00:28:00,767
will soon affect the entire planet,

269
00:28:01,002 --> 00:28:07,004
and in those places where an unjustified sense of triumph still persists

270
00:28:07,733 --> 00:28:14,267
we will see phenomena that will be described in everyday language as “incredible.”

271
00:28:15,009 --> 00:28:19,013
We are moving toward a planetary civilization that will present us with a new form of organization

272
00:28:20,003 --> 00:28:24,370
and a new scale of values, and it is inevitable that it will do so

273
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,467
by taking as a point of departure the most important issue of our time:

274
00:28:28,967 --> 00:28:37,633
knowing whether we wish to live, and in what conditions we wish to do so.

275
00:28:39,033 --> 00:28:44,467
In this segment, several minutes are missing because of defects in the original recording.

276
00:28:45,567 --> 00:28:49,633
I should also emphasize that Humanism derives its explanation of the world,

277
00:28:49,867 --> 00:28:54,500
values, society, politics, art, and history

278
00:28:55,033 --> 00:29:00,267
fundamentally from its conception of the human being;

279
00:29:01,006 --> 00:29:02,673
For contemporary Humanism,

280
00:29:03,467 --> 00:29:11,133
one cannot start from theories about matter, the spirit, or God

281
00:29:12,002 --> 00:29:15,935
—one must start from the structure of human life,

282
00:29:16,133 --> 00:29:22,139
its liberty and intentionality, and logically, no determinism or naturalism

283
00:29:23,133 --> 00:29:33,367
can transform into Humanism, because in its initial assumptions the human being is an accessory.

284
00:29:33,633 --> 00:29:36,667
Today’s Humanism defines human beings as

285
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:45,733
historical beings whose mode of social action transforms their own nature.

286
00:29:48,033 --> 00:29:51,040
Here we find the elements that, duly developed,

287
00:29:51,733 --> 00:29:56,740
could justify a theory and a practice that gives answer to the present emergency.

288
00:29:57,733 --> 00:30:00,300
To go further into considerations of this definition

289
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:05,641
would take us far afield, and there is not enough time to do so.

290
00:30:08,467 --> 00:30:11,133
It can escape no one’s notice that the brief description

291
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:14,338
I have given of civilization and today’s crisis takes as its starting point

292
00:30:15,767 --> 00:30:21,933
a consideration of the structure of human existence, and that this description

293
00:30:21,933 --> 00:30:27,300
is precisely that of contemporary Humanism, applied to the present subject matter.

294
00:30:28,067 --> 00:30:33,300
The terms “crisis of civilization” and “Humanism”

295
00:30:34,133 --> 00:30:37,100
become linked when we propose a vision

296
00:30:37,005 --> 00:30:41,938
that can contribute to overcoming some of today’s difficulties.

297
00:30:43,867 --> 00:30:47,533
Though we go no further in characterizing it,

298
00:30:47,767 --> 00:30:56,033
it should be clear that we are considering the theme of Humanism as a set of ideas,

299
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:07,267
a practical project, a current of opinion, and a possible organization

300
00:31:07,567 --> 00:31:14,570
that can carry forward the objective of both social and personal transformation,

301
00:31:15,003 --> 00:31:25,336
embracing and including concrete and distinct political and cultural particularities,

302
00:31:26,233 --> 00:31:32,241
without these particularities disappearing as forces for change

303
00:31:33,003 --> 00:31:38,006
—particularities that are diverse and yet convergent in their ultimate intentions.

304
00:31:40,433 --> 00:31:45,700
In this moment of change, of decentralization

305
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:53,008
and clamor for the recognition of what are real particularities,

306
00:31:54,133 --> 00:31:57,367
it would not be helpful for anyone to insist

307
00:31:57,667 --> 00:32:02,667
on the hegemony or universality

308
00:32:02,009 --> 00:32:08,542
of any single tendency.

309
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:16,775
I would like to end with a very personal consideration.

310
00:32:18,933 --> 00:32:25,939
During these days I have had the opportunity to attend meetings and seminars

311
00:32:26,009 --> 00:32:33,276
with cultural figures, scientists, and academics.

312
00:32:35,001 --> 00:32:40,534
On more than one occasion I seemed to sense a climate of pessimism

313
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:46,008
when we exchanged ideas about the future that we may soon be living through.

314
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:55,900
At the time I did not feel tempted to make naive pronouncements

315
00:32:56,567 --> 00:33:01,200
or to declare my faith in a happy future.

316
00:33:01,005 --> 00:33:05,172
And yet now I believe that we must make an effort to overcome this disheartenment

317
00:33:06,433 --> 00:33:12,433
by remembering other moments of grave crisis

318
00:33:13,001 --> 00:33:20,034
that the human species has lived through and overcome.

319
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,367
In this regard, I would like to recall those words,

320
00:33:24,667 --> 00:33:26,670
whose sentiment I fully share,

321
00:33:27,233 --> 00:33:32,700
that found voice in the very beginnings of Greek tragedy:

322
00:33:33,567 --> 00:33:38,700
“When all roads were apparently closed,

323
00:33:39,067 --> 00:33:43,075
the human being has always found the way out.”

324
00:33:44,001 --> 00:33:49,868
Thank you very much.
