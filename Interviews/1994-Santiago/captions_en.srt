Silo: Compilation of TV Interviews

2
00:00:07,005 --> 00:00:08,013
Santiago, Chile

3
00:00:09,007 --> 00:00:11,940
May 1994

4
00:00:17,009 --> 00:00:18,012
During the First Gathering of Humanist Culture in Santiago, Chile,

5
00:00:19,567 --> 00:00:21,333
on May 14, 1994,

6
00:00:21,733 --> 00:00:23,167
Silo was invited to present his book, “Letters To My Friends”,

7
00:00:23,533 --> 00:00:26,067
and held a series of interviews with various media.

8
00:00:26,007 --> 00:00:27,012
In this video we have extracted parts of these interviews

9
00:00:28,567 --> 00:00:29,933
and organized them thematically to give the viewer a synthesis

10
00:00:30,533 --> 00:00:32,367
of Silo's opinions on different matters.

11
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:41,300
The Origins of The Movement

12
00:00:43,167 --> 00:00:50,168
Around 1960, various youth movements sprung up all over.

13
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:53,200
Some followed Che Guevara,

14
00:00:53,867 --> 00:00:54,870
who later died in Bolivia.

15
00:00:56,367 --> 00:01:04,600
Others identified with the youth movements of France in 1968, in Paris.

16
00:01:05,167 --> 00:01:10,167
And others followed an Argentinean, Mario Rodriguez Cobos.

17
00:01:10,006 --> 00:01:14,273
He was tall and thin,

18
00:01:15,004 --> 00:01:19,871
and nicknamed Silo,

19
00:01:20,267 --> 00:01:23,600
after the shape of silos where grain is stored in Argentina.

20
00:01:24,002 --> 00:01:27,035
Many years have passed, almost thirty,

21
00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:31,476
and Silo continues to attract people around him,

22
00:01:32,633 --> 00:01:36,767
continues to be a leader, and has become almost a myth.

23
00:01:37,001 --> 00:01:39,007
From a province in Argentina, from Mendoza,

24
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:44,300
Silo transmits his message through his books and letters.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,833
I was listening attentively

26
00:01:47,067 --> 00:01:50,933
when you described that decade, the 60's,

27
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:52,567
a decade in which suddenly there was an explosion of youth

28
00:01:53,267 --> 00:01:56,276
 in different parts of the world.

29
00:01:57,007 --> 00:02:01,040
Of course that explosion wasn't caused by us.

30
00:02:02,033 --> 00:02:06,400
In different parts of the world, this confrontational youth phenomenon erupted.

31
00:02:06,633 --> 00:02:08,637
For some reason, a generation woke up,

32
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:13,042
and began to present their proposals in different ways, as you explained.

33
00:02:14,433 --> 00:02:17,441
The hippies on one hand, the guerrilla movement, drugs,

34
00:02:19,001 --> 00:02:23,068
and the very strong musical movements

35
00:02:23,433 --> 00:02:26,167
which are so accepted today by everyone

36
00:02:26,433 --> 00:02:27,439
– that way they have of expressing themselves.

37
00:02:28,033 --> 00:02:34,038
Well, in that context our first study groups also appeared,

38
00:02:35,033 --> 00:02:36,035
also with young people,

39
00:02:36,433 --> 00:02:38,500
young people of this same generation.

40
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:43,936
These different groups appeared and my friends and I said that this is getting complicated.

41
00:02:44,467 --> 00:02:46,900
What is this crisis that the world is experiencing?

42
00:02:47,003 --> 00:02:49,636
What is this crisis that we all have?

43
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:52,037
We have to study and comprehend it.

44
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:54,567
And this is how we formed the first groups

45
00:02:55,001 --> 00:02:59,001
which in time became the Humanist Movement.

46
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:03,367
When our groups started to become a Movement,

47
00:03:03,633 --> 00:03:05,467
and began to give some sort of an answer,

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,002
compared to that amorphous thing of the hippies and all that,

49
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:13,867
our people of course were the ones that stood out.

50
00:03:14,133 --> 00:03:17,137
They had a kind of consistency, a kind of militancy.

51
00:03:18,004 --> 00:03:22,006
So then, all kinds of terrible things began to be attributed to them,

52
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:24,542
but of course, they couldn't be both

53
00:03:25,733 --> 00:03:27,300
from the left and from the right, and hippies, and well,

54
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:31,015
this small movement was blamed for everything that happened.

55
00:03:33,033 --> 00:03:35,867
If you asked me to say what we were like,

56
00:03:36,001 --> 00:03:37,010
as youth of that time,

57
00:03:38,267 --> 00:03:40,600
I'd say in terms of us

58
00:03:40,867 --> 00:03:43,300
– I can't answer for the hippies or the guerrillas,

59
00:03:43,003 --> 00:03:46,570
I can respond for what we did –

60
00:03:47,433 --> 00:03:50,100
I can say with some sorrow

61
00:03:50,767 --> 00:03:55,000
that we don't think we made errors of youth,

62
00:03:55,003 --> 00:03:57,136
nor do we renounce our past.

63
00:03:57,633 --> 00:03:57,641
You don't renounce anything?

64
00:03:58,007 --> 00:04:03,174
With regard to what we are discussing, we feel that we were right.

65
00:04:04,067 --> 00:04:05,400
What do you regret?

66
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:07,042
Perhaps the fact that we weren't able to channel all that social ferment,

67
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:11,700
which perhaps at that time

68
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:15,334
was ready to be taken in a much more positive direction.

69
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:17,033
What remains of the hippies?

70
00:04:17,233 --> 00:04:19,567
What remains of the guerrilla struggle so in fashion in those days?

71
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:22,467
What remains of the mystical searches in Katmandu?

72
00:04:22,008 --> 00:04:23,013
How did all of that continue developing?

73
00:04:24,433 --> 00:04:27,400
There were many people who followed Silo who are now businessmen,

74
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:31,400
and they've forgotten and don't even want to remember that they belonged to the Movement.

75
00:04:31,633 --> 00:04:35,000
Sure. But the difference is that the Movement continues, grows,

76
00:04:35,267 --> 00:04:37,269
and develops throughout the world.  That is a big difference.

77
00:04:37,867 --> 00:04:41,600
So also in its origins, there must have been big differences with the others.

78
00:04:44,967 --> 00:04:48,033
The Current Crisis

79
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:57,133
There is a big difference in your diagnosis, the Humanist Movement's,

80
00:04:57,004 --> 00:04:58,271
and the general diagnosis.

81
00:04:58,009 --> 00:05:01,942
Because there are many people who have a right to feel optimistic

82
00:05:03,067 --> 00:05:05,500
in the sense that humanity is now in agreement

83
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:09,836
about representative Democracy,

84
00:05:10,005 --> 00:05:12,038
about a more open and competitive economy,

85
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:16,835
respect for our common home, the environment,

86
00:05:17,003 --> 00:05:20,011
and these are like the pillars of 21st century civilization.

87
00:05:21,633 --> 00:05:26,634
But we are in complete disagreement with that diagnosis, that's the problem.

88
00:05:26,967 --> 00:05:27,933
Why?

89
00:05:28,167 --> 00:05:29,700
This is what makes us unpopular.

90
00:05:29,007 --> 00:05:32,640
We should say the opposite, we should sanctify it and say how marvelous everything is.

91
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,633
Then we would be very well accepted.

92
00:05:36,767 --> 00:05:40,000
But what the world is showing us is a very different reality.

93
00:05:40,003 --> 00:05:44,003
80% of the world's population is at,

94
00:05:44,633 --> 00:05:46,700
or below, the poverty level.

95
00:05:47,233 --> 00:05:52,236
We see that things are not going well in government.

96
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,267
This old representative democracy,

97
00:05:55,007 --> 00:05:56,774
the separation of powers,

98
00:05:58,002 --> 00:06:00,835
all of this today is very, very damaged.

99
00:06:01,233 --> 00:06:08,900
Entire governments fall, like the Christian Democrats, and others which were aligned with the Penta Partito in Italy.

100
00:06:09,633 --> 00:06:13,900
The Socialist Party of Felipe Gonzalez is teetering.

101
00:06:14,433 --> 00:06:18,100
Japan, which until very recently was an uncontested model,

102
00:06:18,006 --> 00:06:21,439
is now a scandalous succession of governments, full of corruption,

103
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:28,012
and they are putting the country in a very difficult situation.

104
00:06:29,633 --> 00:06:33,635
Never mind what is happening in poor Africa – so afflicted –

105
00:06:34,133 --> 00:06:38,600
where 150,000 people die every week.

106
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:44,500
Not to mention the famines throughout the continent,

107
00:06:44,767 --> 00:06:46,800
and in many places in Latin America as well.

108
00:06:47,233 --> 00:06:50,200
A dehumanized society has been built,

109
00:06:51,001 --> 00:06:56,234
which dangerously has not taken care to

110
00:06:56,007 --> 00:06:58,040
form new alternatives.

111
00:06:58,967 --> 00:07:00,700
Because if this building has problems,

112
00:07:00,007 --> 00:07:02,240
then where are the fire escapes?

113
00:07:03,433 --> 00:07:05,167
There used to be alternatives, you know,

114
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,975
so that if things got bad in one type of society,

115
00:07:10,033 --> 00:07:14,067
you could swing, like Tarzan on a vine, to another society.

116
00:07:14,004 --> 00:07:14,011
Of course.

117
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:17,233
If capitalism failed there was always socialism.

118
00:07:17,467 --> 00:07:18,900
If socialism failed, well...

119
00:07:19,167 --> 00:07:22,033
Today we have a global situation of only one system,

120
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:27,568
and if this system fails, well, we have to ask ourselves,

121
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:30,012
where are the fire escapes? What are our alternatives?

122
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:36,767
This thinking endeavors to respond to certain questions, at least,

123
00:07:37,033 --> 00:07:38,800
regarding the crisis of today.

124
00:07:39,033 --> 00:07:41,300
There are those with whom we cannot reach any understanding,

125
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:42,936
because they maintain that there is no crisis.

126
00:07:43,467 --> 00:07:45,700
So, of course there is no possibility for discussion.

127
00:07:45,967 --> 00:07:47,971
I maintain that there is a very profound crisis,

128
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:51,838
that this system is nearing collapse.

129
00:07:53,008 --> 00:07:56,275
Some may find this amusing, but for us it is not at all amusing.

130
00:07:57,267 --> 00:08:00,400
We think it's tragic – the increasing unemployment, factory closures,

131
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:03,675
the collective decomposition of Europe and of other models which exist here.

132
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,567
Other alternatives exist, along the lines of:

133
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:09,733
Guys, let's go to the social base,

134
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:11,975
let's get in touch with people in the neighborhoods,

135
00:08:12,767 --> 00:08:16,100
in the community, with our partners,

136
00:08:16,007 --> 00:08:18,074
and let's begin to rebuild the social fabric

137
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,433
that responds less and less every day

138
00:08:21,633 --> 00:08:25,637
to political leaders, to union leaders,

139
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:27,767
and to the opinion-makers of the media.

140
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,667
Another type of phenomenon is arising,

141
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:32,668
and we think it's going that way, towards the social base.

142
00:08:35,733 --> 00:08:38,867
Real Democracy

143
00:08:41,733 --> 00:08:45,467
You say that Formal Democracy has been destabilized, that it doesn't work,

144
00:08:45,007 --> 00:08:47,140
that Representative Democracy is over,

145
00:08:48,033 --> 00:08:49,042
and you propose Real Democracy.

146
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:51,169
I would like you to define first,

147
00:08:51,006 --> 00:08:52,739
what is Real Democracy?

148
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,341
And second, if you don't believe in Formal Democracy,

149
00:08:56,567 --> 00:08:58,572
why did the Humanist Party, inspired by you, participate in the 1993 elections in Chile,

150
00:08:59,367 --> 00:09:01,900
and do so with the hope that it would be in the Parliament

151
00:09:02,233 --> 00:09:06,600
of this formal Democracy?

152
00:09:07,033 --> 00:09:08,767
Very well. First of all,

153
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:12,900
the basis of a Republic is representation,

154
00:09:13,133 --> 00:09:16,200
the separation of powers, and respect for minorities.

155
00:09:17,233 --> 00:09:19,867
If there is no true separation of powers,

156
00:09:20,133 --> 00:09:23,139
if one power designates the other, or has influence over the other,

157
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:30,233
or if a power is not – since they are all democratic – elected by the people,

158
00:09:30,633 --> 00:09:33,200
then I believe that there is a real distortion

159
00:09:33,433 --> 00:09:34,436
of what we understand by Democracy.

160
00:09:34,933 --> 00:09:37,067
That is, if the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial powers

161
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,067
are all part of a Democracy,

162
00:09:39,003 --> 00:09:40,007
what's happening with the Judicial power?

163
00:09:40,007 --> 00:09:41,015
Who names the justices of the Supreme Court?

164
00:09:42,733 --> 00:09:44,867
The people, by direct vote?

165
00:09:45,533 --> 00:09:48,534
Are you proposing that judges be elected by universal and direct votation?

166
00:09:48,633 --> 00:09:51,639
Absolutely.  To which one could respond

167
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:53,475
that this would be politicizing the function…

168
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,467
How are these functions in the different powers

169
00:09:58,008 --> 00:10:00,075
not going to be politicized?

170
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:03,334
They are already, so let's be upfront about it and not formal.

171
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:10,000
Economic System

172
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:17,700
Are you in favor of the free market economy, as it is known in the West?

173
00:10:17,009 --> 00:10:19,010
No, of course not.

174
00:10:20,004 --> 00:10:21,271
How should the economy be?

175
00:10:21,867 --> 00:10:22,876
First of all, I don't think it's free.

176
00:10:23,767 --> 00:10:26,433
This thing of pretending that there are market laws and so on...

177
00:10:26,633 --> 00:10:28,067
those market laws don't exist.

178
00:10:28,067 --> 00:10:31,633
What exists is the regulating done by different interest groups

179
00:10:31,867 --> 00:10:36,100
who at one moment open a valve, and in another close it. No way.

180
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:45,867
I believe the excessive use of the word free, liberalism,

181
00:10:46,467 --> 00:10:49,700
all of that is pretty deceitful, and that things are not at all like that,

182
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,733
they are induced by financial groups.

183
00:10:52,067 --> 00:10:56,073
In any company, profits are for capital,

184
00:10:57,133 --> 00:10:59,900
and the salary or wage is for the worker.

185
00:11:00,167 --> 00:11:05,800
Fine. If that profit is for capital,

186
00:11:05,008 --> 00:11:09,141
it is because there is this idea that it's capital that assumes the risk.

187
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:14,735
From our humanist point of view, the risk is the human risk of the worker.

188
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:17,367
Because if his workplace doors are closed,

189
00:11:17,933 --> 00:11:21,900
he loses his life, he loses all the years he dedicated to that effort.

190
00:11:22,533 --> 00:11:25,300
And this also threatens his family, his children

191
00:11:25,006 --> 00:11:26,539
and all those around him.

192
00:11:27,004 --> 00:11:32,771
So we have to rethink this question of who puts their life in danger.

193
00:11:33,005 --> 00:11:35,012
When capital dominates the company,

194
00:11:37,167 --> 00:11:42,500
and then instead of reinvesting profits into the productive process

195
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:46,376
– or if there is market saturation and it's not possible to expand the company

196
00:11:47,005 --> 00:11:48,538
to create new jobs,

197
00:11:49,233 --> 00:11:54,500
that capital should in any case be reinvested into the productive circuit

198
00:11:54,733 --> 00:11:56,100
to create new sources of work.

199
00:11:56,367 --> 00:11:59,370
The theme here is jobs and increasing production.

200
00:12:00,133 --> 00:12:04,100
If on the contrary, if that capital,

201
00:12:05,033 --> 00:12:09,000
instead of being reinvested,

202
00:12:09,002 --> 00:12:13,569
is moved into the speculative financial circuit,

203
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:16,300
and then as a result people must be layed-off,

204
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:18,670
production increased in a tyrannical way,

205
00:12:19,467 --> 00:12:21,133
all sorts of modifications have to be made so that

206
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:24,342
what increases is not production

207
00:12:25,533 --> 00:12:29,567
but the circulation of financial capital,

208
00:12:30,133 --> 00:12:33,137
and companies go bankrupt all over,

209
00:12:34,001 --> 00:12:36,568
then the one harmed is the worker

210
00:12:37,005 --> 00:12:39,011
who ends up in the street with no work.

211
00:12:40,006 --> 00:12:42,873
But don't banks lend money in order to create new companies?

212
00:12:43,007 --> 00:12:47,009
Sure. They lend money and then demand to manage that money.

213
00:12:48,233 --> 00:12:50,600
For example, they lend it at the international level,

214
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:54,170
they lend these soft loans at some point to a dictatorship.

215
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:59,011
Later that dictatorship goes into debt with the International Monetary Fund

216
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:03,334
or the international banks – not the people, not the people! –

217
00:13:04,006 --> 00:13:07,010
and then of course the time comes when the debt must be paid.

218
00:13:09,001 --> 00:13:12,434
Of course things change, because the interest rate changes.

219
00:13:12,933 --> 00:13:14,939
In other words, there's such a build-up that

220
00:13:15,533 --> 00:13:17,167
in the end the debt can never be repaid,

221
00:13:17,467 --> 00:13:20,467
and you're more in debt than when you borrowed in the first place.

222
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:23,009
That is, the payment to be made

223
00:13:24,133 --> 00:13:25,300
becomes increasingly astronomical,

224
00:13:25,533 --> 00:13:29,267
and that is what happens in almost all Latin American countries.

225
00:13:29,006 --> 00:13:30,173
This is a serious situation,

226
00:13:31,033 --> 00:13:36,034
because instead of promoting the development of countries,

227
00:13:36,006 --> 00:13:38,012
the banks are draining the resources out of every country,

228
00:13:39,007 --> 00:13:44,840
even though certain signs of development appear more or less

229
00:13:46,001 --> 00:13:49,734
in the downtowns of the important capital cities.

230
00:13:50,133 --> 00:13:51,142
In reality, what's happening

231
00:13:52,233 --> 00:13:54,237
is that the lower segments of the population get poorer,

232
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:59,868
while the other 20% increases its profits as does, of course, financial capital.

233
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:01,133
And how do you change this?

234
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:03,136
With laws, by prohibiting banks, by eliminating banks,

235
00:14:03,633 --> 00:14:05,667
by restricting their activities?

236
00:14:06,467 --> 00:14:07,473
No... these solutions cannot be partial.

237
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:09,334
But wait, I ask you..

238
00:14:09,733 --> 00:14:10,800
They cannot be partial.

239
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:13,033
If a Humanist Party became the government

240
00:14:13,367 --> 00:14:15,733
and had all the power because they had a parliamentary majority,

241
00:14:15,733 --> 00:14:21,267
and had all the power to modify things,

242
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:23,933
what would they do? Get rid of the banks?

243
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:27,933
No, banks would be used to lend without interest.

244
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,300
Here we have to begin to revalue the value of work.

245
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:32,836
I believe there is going to be a big discussion....

246
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:35,500
Everybody says that, company owners say that, everybody says that...

247
00:14:35,005 --> 00:14:36,538
And that's very good – we'll have to do it then,

248
00:14:37,033 --> 00:14:38,767
because it hasn't been done yet.

249
00:14:39,001 --> 00:14:40,009
If company owners are saying that, great,

250
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:41,016
let's start the discussion.

251
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:48,400
The Conception of the Human Being

252
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:52,833
In terms of human life,

253
00:14:53,001 --> 00:14:56,004
we have points of view diametrically opposed to other currents.

254
00:14:56,009 --> 00:14:59,676
There are currents that state that the human being is born immediately,

255
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,001
that is, it gains existence when gestation…

256
00:15:04,367 --> 00:15:05,200
At conception.

257
00:15:05,002 --> 00:15:06,535
Right. For us, it's not like that.

258
00:15:06,733 --> 00:15:08,000
That's the conception of the Catholic church.

259
00:15:08,002 --> 00:15:09,035
Right. For us, it's not like that.

260
00:15:09,233 --> 00:15:10,400
No? So when does human life start?

261
00:15:10,004 --> 00:15:12,004
No, not at all. It starts at the moment of birth,

262
00:15:12,006 --> 00:15:15,012
at the moment in which the human being manifests itself in the world.

263
00:15:16,004 --> 00:15:18,037
That is, according to our theoretical conception

264
00:15:18,008 --> 00:15:21,441
that the human being is open to the world and to society,

265
00:15:22,233 --> 00:15:24,233
it's at birth when that takes place.

266
00:15:24,433 --> 00:15:29,467
So, at 8 month and 28 days, there is no life.

267
00:15:29,467 --> 00:15:32,700
Sure there is life, but not human life.

268
00:15:32,009 --> 00:15:33,142
There is no human being.

269
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:35,700
The human being constitutes itself in time.

270
00:15:35,007 --> 00:15:37,840
And the human being is a historical being, not a natural being.

271
00:15:38,533 --> 00:15:43,200
But, what difference is there between a being that is born and one just about to be born?

272
00:15:43,002 --> 00:15:44,635
The change of environment.

273
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:50,300
So the change of environment makes a being into a human being?

274
00:15:50,005 --> 00:15:52,009
No, it makes it a human project in any case.

275
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:55,010
It's an animal being that could become human or not.

276
00:15:56,233 --> 00:16:00,235
Birth, for us, is the fundamental part of change of environment,

277
00:16:00,007 --> 00:16:03,340
where the human being opens to the world at the moment of birth.

278
00:16:04,233 --> 00:16:05,236
But then from that point of view,

279
00:16:05,767 --> 00:16:07,233
abortion would be perfectly justifiable

280
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:08,540
at any stage of pregnancy,

281
00:16:09,933 --> 00:16:11,934
because we would not be in the presence of a human being.

282
00:16:12,267 --> 00:16:13,100
That's right.

283
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,342
And if what we are preserving is the value of life,

284
00:16:15,233 --> 00:16:17,167
according to your theory, there is no life...

285
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:18,542
Sure there is life, but not a human being.

286
00:16:19,433 --> 00:16:20,867
There isn't human life, there isn't a human being.

287
00:16:20,867 --> 00:16:24,833
And so the mother would in the presence of something

288
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,567
as close to her as a tumor or something like that.

289
00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:28,568
Of course not.

290
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:28,669
And she could dispose of it...

291
00:16:28,933 --> 00:16:30,867
Of course not. Because there is a project.

292
00:16:31,001 --> 00:16:35,568
Every mother who wants to have a child is thinking of a life project.

293
00:16:35,667 --> 00:16:37,900
And the one who didn't want it, an unwanted pregnancy?

294
00:16:38,002 --> 00:16:41,035
The one who didn't want it... we'd have to see what the mother says.

295
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,400
And we have to have a big discussion,

296
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:45,942
and women have to take the central place

297
00:16:47,233 --> 00:16:48,700
in the discussion around these problems.

298
00:16:48,933 --> 00:16:50,867
I believe that these things should not be hidden.

299
00:16:51,233 --> 00:16:53,700
There are leaders who are in favor of abortion in special circumstances,

300
00:16:53,933 --> 00:16:56,467
others who are in favor of divorce,

301
00:16:56,667 --> 00:16:59,700
others who speak in favor of the family,

302
00:16:59,933 --> 00:17:01,938
or this real family as you call it.

303
00:17:03,033 --> 00:17:04,767
How are you different from those leaders?

304
00:17:05,001 --> 00:17:07,568
Yes, I say this and it's true what you say

305
00:17:07,933 --> 00:17:09,700
because I have noticed that as well.

306
00:17:10,033 --> 00:17:13,667
It seems to me that sometimes many people who coincide with one's point of view

307
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:15,667
don't coincide in other things.

308
00:17:16,267 --> 00:17:18,200
Why do they coincide in some things and not in others?

309
00:17:18,533 --> 00:17:19,539
Because it seems to me that generally,

310
00:17:20,767 --> 00:17:24,768
those who give those opinions don't have a conception of the human being.

311
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,635
And they act a little pragmatically,

312
00:17:27,167 --> 00:17:29,500
or according to the times,

313
00:17:30,067 --> 00:17:31,833
or the balance that has to be made,

314
00:17:32,433 --> 00:17:33,437
in order to say one thing or another.

315
00:17:34,003 --> 00:17:38,070
Here, in my case, I believe there is great difference,

316
00:17:38,007 --> 00:17:40,010
there is a conception of the human being.

317
00:17:41,006 --> 00:17:43,873
And if you don't have a clear conception of the human being,

318
00:17:45,267 --> 00:17:46,271
you're going to give an answer in one area

319
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:49,300
that is completely opposed to one in another area, and so on.

320
00:17:50,001 --> 00:17:52,434
If you like, and you can give me a little time,

321
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:54,839
I'll tell you what I think about this.

322
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:57,933
For example, regarding abortion.

323
00:17:58,467 --> 00:18:05,033
To me, the position of the Catholic church is very coherent.

324
00:18:05,007 --> 00:18:06,940
The Catholic church thinks that

325
00:18:07,867 --> 00:18:12,872
once the sperm intercrosses with the egg,

326
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:17,242
the divine spark reaches that being and it becomes a human being.

327
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,338
If you have this conception of the human being,

328
00:18:22,006 --> 00:18:25,013
that being in development is not only a human being,

329
00:18:26,533 --> 00:18:29,534
but in fact a human being with a soul and a whole set of attributes.

330
00:18:30,004 --> 00:18:33,137
Imagine, with that conception,

331
00:18:34,433 --> 00:18:39,400
anyone who commits abortion would clearly be sinning

332
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:43,067
and would also be committing murder.

333
00:18:43,733 --> 00:18:47,167
Because it's assumed that there is already a human being there.

334
00:18:47,005 --> 00:18:50,008
And if a human being exists and you interrupt its development,

335
00:18:51,367 --> 00:18:53,373
you are committing murder, plain and simple.

336
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:57,100
That is the position of the Catholic church.

337
00:18:57,733 --> 00:19:00,741
To me, saying that whoever interrupts the process commits murder

338
00:19:02,002 --> 00:19:07,469
is coherent with that position.

339
00:19:08,001 --> 00:19:13,068
But what about those who do not share that point of view?

340
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:14,837
For example, in our case,

341
00:19:15,005 --> 00:19:18,072
we have a vision of the human being,

342
00:19:18,967 --> 00:19:22,973
we believe that the baby that is developing and has not come out to the world

343
00:19:24,002 --> 00:19:27,969
is simply a natural being, and a project, as well.

344
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:29,673
That's why people want to have children.

345
00:19:30,006 --> 00:19:32,139
They aspire that they become human beings,

346
00:19:33,001 --> 00:19:34,634
they want to have descendants.

347
00:19:35,267 --> 00:19:39,300
But we say, only at the moment of birth,

348
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:43,671
in the moment of the opening to the world –

349
00:19:44,467 --> 00:19:46,733
which is what characterizes the essence of the human being –

350
00:19:47,033 --> 00:19:51,037
only in that moment does a human being appear in the world.

351
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:52,900
At the moment of birth.

352
00:19:53,001 --> 00:19:56,003
As you can see, the differences in point of view are enormous.

353
00:19:56,005 --> 00:20:00,172
Now I would have to justify why I say that it's at the moment of birth

354
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:02,733
– well, others would also have to justify

355
00:20:02,967 --> 00:20:06,000
why they say it's at the moment of… This is a long discussion.

356
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:07,341
But one must be coherent.

357
00:20:08,867 --> 00:20:10,871
The conception that we have of the human being

358
00:20:11,533 --> 00:20:13,700
allows us to say things like this.

359
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:16,338
It allows us to say that institutions are historical,

360
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:22,900
that the supposedly permanent institution of the nucleus of society

361
00:20:23,433 --> 00:20:27,438
is not so permanent and is not natural, but historical.

362
00:20:28,567 --> 00:20:32,000
It allows us to say that intentions are what matter

363
00:20:32,004 --> 00:20:35,037
because they are what give direction to human acts.

364
00:20:35,008 --> 00:20:36,941
And so in one moment we are in agreement and in another, in disagreement.

365
00:20:38,233 --> 00:20:41,233
We have to resolve these things.

366
00:20:41,008 --> 00:20:42,017
It's the conception of the human being.

367
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,567
The Situation of Youth

368
00:20:52,267 --> 00:20:54,275
Because today we find ourselves in a situation

369
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,013
in which the breakdown between generations,

370
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:59,872
the lack of communication between the world of adults and of youth,

371
00:21:01,267 --> 00:21:06,272
the lack of youth participation in the plans proposed by society,

372
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:09,200
is reaching dangerous levels.

373
00:21:09,567 --> 00:21:12,700
If a whole generation does not participate in that plan,

374
00:21:13,367 --> 00:21:15,376
things can get complicated because the mechanisms get stuck,

375
00:21:16,006 --> 00:21:21,739
and also because other, more violent forms of participation could be attempted...

376
00:21:22,867 --> 00:21:26,400
I was saying that it was important to comprehend that era,

377
00:21:27,003 --> 00:21:31,236
because by understanding it well, it would help us to understand today's situation.

378
00:21:32,001 --> 00:21:34,334
The generational breakdown that occurred,

379
00:21:35,233 --> 00:21:38,667
the attacks suffered by youth in every sense,

380
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:44,767
the wounds that were opened in that generation that did not heal completely,

381
00:21:45,433 --> 00:21:49,800
brought about, it seems to me, a sort of historical breach

382
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,841
– one that has continued unresolved up to today –

383
00:21:54,367 --> 00:21:57,433
in which a deep void of participation in the world of adults

384
00:21:58,002 --> 00:22:01,009
 by the new generations has been produced.

385
00:22:02,005 --> 00:22:05,472
That's why I say that it wasn't interpreted, done, or understood well.

386
00:22:06,233 --> 00:22:10,100
Responding hysterically to the expressions of youth,

387
00:22:11,033 --> 00:22:13,300
however good or bad these may have been,

388
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:17,733
didn't help in understanding the process.

389
00:22:18,167 --> 00:22:19,174
They were starting to express themselves in a world,

390
00:22:20,133 --> 00:22:21,700
it was a young world that was opening up.

391
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:24,267
That was not understood correctly

392
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:27,567
and its consequences continue up to today.

393
00:22:28,001 --> 00:22:32,003
It's a background problem, more than one of intellectual analysis.

394
00:22:32,633 --> 00:22:35,200
I remember the last words of Willy Brandt –

395
00:22:35,467 --> 00:22:38,900
a great politician and also a man of great civic spirit.

396
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:42,800
He was about to die and some journalists went to see him,

397
00:22:43,867 --> 00:22:46,200
and asked him, just recently,

398
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:51,467
“How do you understand this neo-Nazism in the Germany that you have loved so much,

399
00:22:51,733 --> 00:22:53,200
for which you have suffered so much?

400
00:22:53,433 --> 00:22:55,767
How is it that the new generations, the youth,

401
00:22:56,067 --> 00:23:00,072
are starting again with neo-Nazism, with cruelty,

402
00:23:01,033 --> 00:23:02,467
with all these things?”

403
00:23:02,667 --> 00:23:03,674
And poor Willy Brandt did not give the explanation that

404
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:06,668
a politician would have given, like for example,

405
00:23:06,767 --> 00:23:10,772
it's because they are getting paid less, or there are evictions, etc.

406
00:23:11,667 --> 00:23:16,133
He said, “I believe that youth are desperate.”

407
00:23:16,367 --> 00:23:20,370
To me it was a very important answer.

408
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:24,700
I don't know if we have to dissect youth so much.

409
00:23:24,933 --> 00:23:26,967
I believe they are in a very difficult situation

410
00:23:27,002 --> 00:23:29,005
and that there are superficial things that attract them.

411
00:23:30,002 --> 00:23:31,935
But there are also more profound things that attract them.

412
00:23:32,367 --> 00:23:34,373
It's not exactly something ethereal.

413
00:23:35,367 --> 00:23:37,376
It's about their survival, their very existence.

414
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Why would youth be interested in our poor way of thinking?

415
00:23:43,533 --> 00:23:45,767
Because they must recognize

416
00:23:46,002 --> 00:23:48,135
not only a rational but a vital truth in it,

417
00:23:48,008 --> 00:23:50,175
some truth about their existence in everything we say.

418
00:23:51,003 --> 00:23:53,006
How long, for how many years have they been desperate?

419
00:23:55,001 --> 00:23:56,005
How many decades?

420
00:23:56,733 --> 00:23:57,737
Yes, it's been a long time, but now it's serious.

421
00:24:00,167 --> 00:24:03,233
A Little More….

422
00:24:05,667 --> 00:24:07,668
When I found out that we were going to interview you

423
00:24:08,067 --> 00:24:09,075
and I received some material I wasn't familiar with,

424
00:24:10,006 --> 00:24:14,006
I was hoping to find something really strong, radical,

425
00:24:15,733 --> 00:24:20,400
that would really contain all those supposedly scary elements.

426
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:22,834
Instead I found myself with something much more conventional

427
00:24:23,133 --> 00:24:24,900
– I'd say even boring – than what I was expecting.

428
00:24:25,967 --> 00:24:27,000
I'm sure.

429
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,067
I did not see anything that could be qualified as extraordinary,

430
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:32,076
in terms of calling for something unusual.

431
00:24:34,167 --> 00:24:36,800
And above all I was left with the sensation, Mr. Rodriguez,

432
00:24:37,033 --> 00:24:39,037
that your thinking, at least what I've seen of it,

433
00:24:40,033 --> 00:24:43,067
has no central element that synthesizes it and that

434
00:24:43,467 --> 00:24:47,470
summarizes the main point, the direction in which your movement is going,

435
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,001
towards which the people who follow you are aspiring.

436
00:24:50,667 --> 00:24:52,672
It seemed like there were lots of little ideas,

437
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:55,370
or medium-size ideas, many of them very conventional,

438
00:24:56,667 --> 00:24:59,600
and some unintelligible – which we'll discuss later.

439
00:24:59,009 --> 00:25:00,676
So, the first thing I want to ask you

440
00:25:01,567 --> 00:25:03,033
is probably what a lot of people want to know.

441
00:25:03,267 --> 00:25:05,275
What is the essence of your thinking – if there is one –

442
00:25:06,003 --> 00:25:10,870
for which so many people follow you, gather around, listen to you, read you, etc.?

443
00:25:13,167 --> 00:25:15,500
It's pretty simple, it's not a complicated thinking.

444
00:25:15,007 --> 00:25:17,009
It's as you say, pretty boring in many aspects,

445
00:25:19,633 --> 00:25:20,640
and not very well defined.

446
00:25:21,733 --> 00:25:24,500
Because really this thinking does not intend to be

447
00:25:24,005 --> 00:25:28,172
a “leader of the masses”, or anything like that.

448
00:25:28,967 --> 00:25:31,200
It aims to give a soft alternative

449
00:25:31,967 --> 00:25:33,976
to the many serious problems that we have,

450
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:37,467
that the world in general has, that we have in Latin America.

451
00:25:38,005 --> 00:25:41,372
In short, one of the main points of this thinking

452
00:25:42,733 --> 00:25:46,500
is the vision of the human being,

453
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:49,871
a being that is open to the world, a being in constant change,

454
00:25:50,567 --> 00:25:52,433
a historical being that does not have a "nature".

455
00:25:52,007 --> 00:25:55,140
This creates some arguments later,

456
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:58,833
around the exact moment in which humans are born and things like that.

457
00:25:59,006 --> 00:26:02,439
It's a pretty historical thinking,

458
00:26:03,667 --> 00:26:07,533
meaning that it believes in changes, not in fixed institutions.

459
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:13,838
I could tell you that the main ethical principle is,

460
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:16,873
treat others as you want others to treat you, and things will go better.

461
00:26:18,004 --> 00:26:19,007
It seems that's been said before...

462
00:26:19,007 --> 00:26:22,010
Yes, 2000 years before Christ it was already being said, no doubt.

463
00:26:23,467 --> 00:26:27,469
And the accent was always placed on the capacity for personal evolution,

464
00:26:27,933 --> 00:26:30,900
to transform society from there on?

465
00:26:31,004 --> 00:26:32,137
Yes, certainly.

466
00:26:32,767 --> 00:26:38,700
But we have been adjusting our conception,

467
00:26:39,003 --> 00:26:41,570
and this capacity for personal transformation depends on

468
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:45,600
the possibilities that the environment provides in a given moment.

469
00:26:46,267 --> 00:26:48,700
Because if they have you oppressed, in terrible conditions,

470
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,667
if you are close to starvation, if there are no jobs,

471
00:26:54,467 --> 00:26:58,100
no possibilities for work, if all that happens,

472
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:03,567
then the possibilities for personal improvement are also greatly reduced.

473
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,567
So we believe that

474
00:27:05,867 --> 00:27:08,233
social transformation is very important,

475
00:27:08,567 --> 00:27:11,633
together with personal transformation.

476
00:27:11,967 --> 00:27:13,976
Listening to you, Mario Rodriquez, this doubt arises within me.

477
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,575
When you are gone,

478
00:27:17,367 --> 00:27:19,433
what do you think will survive of your work?

479
00:27:20,667 --> 00:27:23,800
Of my work, I don't think anything is going to survive because…

480
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,009
Or, at least what do you feel is the most important?

481
00:27:26,002 --> 00:27:30,004
I believe that the work itself is a pretext for communication with people.

482
00:27:30,633 --> 00:27:31,637
And that's what is most important?

483
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:34,241
I believe that the most important thing is communication with the human being.

484
00:27:35,003 --> 00:27:37,009
Are you one of those people who think that the world should change first,

485
00:27:38,133 --> 00:27:41,500
that you should change first, or that things change when one influences the surrounding environment?

486
00:27:41,767 --> 00:27:43,500
I believe that things move simultaneously...

487
00:27:43,767 --> 00:27:44,633
All three things?

488
00:27:44,867 --> 00:27:48,333
No, I believe that you change the world in the measure that you change yourself.

489
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:50,400
And what is the healthiest attitude, rebellion?

490
00:27:51,367 --> 00:27:54,133
Well, it depends on the situation, and to what point you have been pushed.

491
00:27:56,233 --> 00:27:57,700
You are not telling me anything.

492
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:59,233
Well, what are you saying?

493
00:28:00,033 --> 00:28:02,067
That I should tell you what is the healthiest attitude,

494
00:28:02,067 --> 00:28:03,071
to change the world or to change oneself?

495
00:28:03,467 --> 00:28:04,800
Because one has an attitude in front of things.

496
00:28:04,008 --> 00:28:04,975
What is your attitude?

497
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,133
As a journalist once said, and it's true,

498
00:28:08,367 --> 00:28:10,371
my attitude is tactically pessimistic but strategically optimistic.

499
00:28:10,767 --> 00:28:13,769
That is, I think we have problems, but we are advancing.

500
00:28:14,667 --> 00:28:17,600
Is “sensitivity” a correct attitude before the world?

501
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,567
Sensitivity is a way of feeling the world,

502
00:28:20,008 --> 00:28:21,441
through perception, through the skin.

503
00:28:22,005 --> 00:28:24,011
Not only through ideas. Ideas…

504
00:28:25,433 --> 00:28:27,967
When Hegel was very old, that great thinker ended up saying:

505
00:28:28,004 --> 00:28:31,006
“Reason is a bone, it has no flesh,

506
00:28:32,005 --> 00:28:34,538
and in the end does not allow you to reach reality.”

507
00:28:35,003 --> 00:28:36,136
On to concrete things.

508
00:28:36,433 --> 00:28:38,400
What do you identify as the three main factors of change

509
00:28:38,004 --> 00:28:40,171
in the world today?

510
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:46,337
Well, the withdrawal of youth from institutionalized power.

511
00:28:47,633 --> 00:28:50,600
Are you saying that the motor of history is the generational crisis?

512
00:28:50,833 --> 00:28:52,500
Certainly, I have always said it.

513
00:28:52,008 --> 00:28:53,008
Number two?

514
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:58,169
Number two – the concentration of financial capital in increasingly fewer hands.

515
00:28:58,767 --> 00:29:01,200
Number three – the disappearance of nation states

516
00:29:01,002 --> 00:29:04,435
and the rise of regionalizations, which go hand in hand,

517
00:29:05,567 --> 00:29:11,433
through ALALC, the European Economic Community,

518
00:29:12,567 --> 00:29:13,570
or the Free Trade Agreement.

519
00:29:13,867 --> 00:29:15,875
Regionalizations are doing away with nation states.

520
00:29:17,033 --> 00:29:20,034
I believe it's a point of crisis, perhaps for the good,

521
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:22,300
but it's a point of crisis.

522
00:29:22,633 --> 00:29:24,300
What is more important, freedom or equality?

523
00:29:25,567 --> 00:29:26,571
Freedom, no doubt.

524
00:29:27,367 --> 00:29:30,233
As for equality I have my serious doubts.

525
00:29:30,433 --> 00:29:33,442
I believe in the confluence, the convergence of diversity.

526
00:29:34,006 --> 00:29:35,139
What is the limit of freedom?

527
00:29:36,002 --> 00:29:37,007
The freedom of the other.

528
00:29:38,033 --> 00:29:40,034
Can freedom exist without responsibility?

529
00:29:42,033 --> 00:29:46,067
Responsibility is something that has to do with commitment

530
00:29:46,267 --> 00:29:48,268
and not with imposed laws.

531
00:29:49,002 --> 00:29:53,004
A person can make commitments if he can choose among possibilities.

532
00:29:54,067 --> 00:29:55,233
Where does morality fit in?

533
00:29:55,633 --> 00:29:59,600
Morality, said Lenin, is a fetishist sauce for a useful meal.

534
00:29:59,008 --> 00:30:00,016
I don't entirely agree, but I believe that morality –

535
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:04,141
morality in quotes, superficial morality –

536
00:30:05,005 --> 00:30:07,538
has often been in the service of things that have nothing to do

537
00:30:08,004 --> 00:30:13,137
with what I understand to be the moral of

538
00:30:14,004 --> 00:30:17,971
treat others as you would have them treat you.

539
00:30:18,008 --> 00:30:20,015
You no longer incite passions. Does this make you happy, sad…?

540
00:30:22,008 --> 00:30:26,015
It seems very good to not incite them. The sad thing is that they're incited anyway.

541
00:30:29,633 --> 00:30:31,767
Mario Rodriquez, how do you compare the sixties to the nineties?

542
00:30:32,033 --> 00:30:33,600
I believe that things have changed enormously.

543
00:30:33,008 --> 00:30:34,341
What was magnificent about the 60's?

544
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:37,141
Nothing at all. It seems to me that the youth rebellion of the 60's

545
00:30:38,433 --> 00:30:41,467
that got so much publicity was a fiasco.

546
00:30:41,967 --> 00:30:42,970
What was so deplorable about the '60s?

547
00:30:43,867 --> 00:30:48,633
It was deplorable in its disorganized thinking,

548
00:30:48,867 --> 00:30:49,871
in the disorganization of the proposals,

549
00:30:50,533 --> 00:30:53,067
and it was very easily channeled into hippie-ism,

550
00:30:53,067 --> 00:30:56,300
guerrilla movements, into all of those things which disappeared.

551
00:30:56,533 --> 00:30:58,167
We have not disappeared.

552
00:30:58,367 --> 00:31:00,433
And in what way were the 60's like any other historical period?

553
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:04,300
How were they similar? In the generational dialectic itself,

554
00:31:04,003 --> 00:31:07,336
in the fact that a young generation opposes the one in power.

555
00:31:07,633 --> 00:31:10,634
At age 56, have you started to think about death, or not yet?

556
00:31:10,933 --> 00:31:12,200
I have always thought about death.

557
00:31:12,007 --> 00:31:14,009
I believe that in general there are many things

558
00:31:14,009 --> 00:31:16,442
that make people avoid facing death in order to carry on.

559
00:31:17,933 --> 00:31:20,967
I always take the fact of death into account and it seems very important to me.

560
00:31:21,233 --> 00:31:24,237
Last question. What would like your epitaph to say?

561
00:31:25,367 --> 00:31:30,333
He was a good person, but a bad writer.

562
